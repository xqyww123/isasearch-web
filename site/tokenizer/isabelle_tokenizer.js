/**
 * The JavaScript half of §5's tokenizer — the one the Worker runs against a query,
 * where the Python half (`Isabelle_Semantic_Embedding/isabelle_tokenizer.py`) built
 * the index. They must agree byte for byte or the site returns silently wrong
 * results with no error anywhere, so this file is written to be read beside that one:
 * same order, same names, same algorithm, not a second reading of the same prose.
 *
 * Two prohibitions from §5.5, both of which fail silently when broken:
 *
 * - **No table and no character class of its own.** Everything it classifies by comes
 *   from the asset. In particular it never asks JavaScript: `\p{L}` is not
 *   `isalpha()` (145,672 code points against 136,104 under Unicode 15), `\p{Nd}`
 *   rejects `²` where `isdigit()` accepts it, and `\s` disagrees with `isspace()` in
 *   both directions — `\s` takes U+FEFF, `isspace()` takes U+001C to U+001F and
 *   U+0085. All four appear in the corpus (§16.4).
 * - **It refuses an asset whose `tokenizer_rule` it does not implement**, rather than
 *   reading its tables and applying different rules to them.
 *
 * And one hazard peculiar to this side: a **character** is a Unicode code point,
 * never a UTF-16 code unit. 4.15 % of the corpus's expressions carry a character
 * above U+FFFF, so a port that indexes by code unit emits unpaired surrogates that
 * JSON transports intact and no query can ever match. Every loop here iterates code
 * points, and the fold scan works over an array of them rather than over the string.
