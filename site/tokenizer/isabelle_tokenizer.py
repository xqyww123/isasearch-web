r"""The production tokenizer of §5 — the one the site export and the query path share.

Two properties make this file what it is, and both are stated as prohibitions in
§5.5 because a violation of either is silent:

* **It carries no table and no character class of its own.** Everything it
  classifies by comes from the asset (`tokenizer_asset`), so the JavaScript port
  can read the same file and cannot drift by consulting `\p{L}` where this
  consulted `isalpha`.
* **It refuses an asset whose `tokenizer_rule` it does not implement.** The
  namespace name embeds the asset's digest, so an index and its asset cannot come
  apart; this is the other half — that the *code* agrees with the file.

It differs from `site/prototype/tokenize_prototype.py`, which measures rather than
specifies, in exactly two ways: it iterates characters instead of Isabelle symbols
(D43), and it has §5.2's numeric token class, which the prototype lacks entirely.
