r"""Tokenize `inputs.jsonl` with the production Python implementation and check the
result against the one committed digest (§16.6).

There is no committed expectations file. `--check` recomputes the digest of this
implementation's output over the committed inputs and compares it with
`expected.json`; `emit.mjs` does the same on the JavaScript side against the same
number. So a divergence between the two implementations moves exactly one digest, and
a change that hits both moves both — and moving is itself the signal, which is what
catches a rule change that forgot to bump `tokenizer_rule` (§16.4: without the bump
the asset's bytes do not move, so the namespace name does not move, and §8.2's "write
into a new namespace" silently becomes an upsert into the live one).

    python3 emit.py            write the output to stdout, for diffing against emit.mjs
    python3 emit.py --check    recompute and compare with expected.json
    python3 emit.py --update   rewrite expected.json from the current implementation

Needs neither Isabelle nor the rest of this package: the tokenizer reads the committed
asset and nothing else, which is the property §5.5 exists to establish and this file
must not quietly undermine.
