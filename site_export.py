r"""The site export (SEMANTIC_SEARCH_SITE_PLAN.md §8): the semantic DB becomes a
turbopuffer namespace.

One run does §8.1's steps in their order, and each of the four guards below stops it
loudly rather than let it publish something wrong:

* **the component guard (D46)** — the asset this machine builds is compared with the
  committed asset of the previous export, and a changed symbol-file list, a changed
  `tokenizer_rule` or a changed digest stops the run.  Registering an unrelated
  Isabelle component moves the asset digest, and the digest names the namespace
  (§8.2), so without this the export would quietly build a differently-named index;
* **the completeness gate (§8.1 step 1)** — every shippable record must have a
  vector.  The vector store is a lazy cache and a missing vector is legal in normal
  operation, which is exactly why the export cannot treat it as normal;
* **the separator probe (§8.1 step 0b)** — one upsert into a test namespace,
  checking that turbopuffer stores and indexes the whitespace-only element that
  keeps a `ContainsTokenSequence` from straddling two theory names (§6.3).  It runs
  on every export rather than once by hand, because §8.2 makes every export a fresh
  namespace and a wrong separator is only visible as a theory filter that matches a
  name no theory has;
* **the fresh-namespace guard (§8.2)** — a namespace that already exists is refused
  unless this run is continuing from its own checkpoint.  turbopuffer cannot drop
  what a batch omits, so an upsert into a live namespace leaves every deleted entity
  behind forever.

Nothing here holds the corpus in memory: records stream out of the store in key
order and go up in batches, so a re-run resumes where the last one stopped.
