# Self-consistency audit of SEMANTIC_SEARCH_SITE_PLAN.md

Run 2026-08-18 by an agent given the plan, its companion
`SEMANTIC_SEARCH_SITE_PLAN_DONE.md`, and nothing else. About sixty findings. This file is
the work list; it is not evidence, and the plan remains the authority on anything the two
disagree about.

**Line numbers were taken before the first round of fixes and have moved.** Grep the
quoted text instead.

A second audit — the plan checked against the code and the corpus rather than against
itself — is appended below.

## Repaired 2026-08-19

**Every item on both lists below has been acted on**, in
`SEMANTIC_SEARCH_SITE_PLAN.md`, `SEMANTIC_SEARCH_SITE_PLAN_DONE.md` and
`site/prototype/README.md`. The lists are kept because they say what was wrong and are
the record of it; they are no longer a work list. Two things a reader should know about
how the repair was done:

- **Every figure was re-measured rather than transcribed from these findings.** Twenty
  of them turned out to be right and were used; four were not, and the plan carries
  the numbers measured on 2026-08-19: the vector store holds **1,354,534 real vectors
  plus 7,809 tombstones**, which is one key per entity record exactly (this audit
  reported 1,355,257 / 7,810, having counted 723 per-theory `finished` markers as
  vectors); §14.7's primed-name figures are **158,120 expressions and 47,768 names**;
  D46's phi-System contribution is **185 symbols**, not 112, being the difference
  between the distribution's 439 and the loaded 624; and the word-glyph-escape count
  is **1,980**.
- **Two claims were verified by running them rather than accepted**: D43's
  3,135 / 3,118 / 17 split reproduced to the record, with the three AFP records among
  the 17 confirmed as `AbsCFCorrect.lemma6` and
  `AbsCFCorrect.contour_a_class.abs_cnt_initial` in `Shivers-CFA` and `Matrix.matrix`
  in `Kleene_Algebra`; and §16.2's 32 cases plus §5.3's 11 relations ran clean under
  **both** the prototype's `symbol_explode` rule and the character-level rule §5 now
  specifies — 0 mismatches under either, which is what made §16.3 step 1's acceptance
  test repairable rather than merely wrong.

**What the repair could not close, because it is code and not prose:** D11's fix.
`Tools/pide_state.ML` still calls `Token.source_of` where D11 says `Token.unparse`, and
the comment above it still asserts the thing §10.1 disproves. The plan now states this
plainly under D11 instead of leaving §10's "done" to imply otherwise. It is a two-line
change on a fallback path and wants a test, so it is left as work rather than folded
into a documentation pass.

## Already fixed, commit 5a42646

- §16.2 carried "It is derived from `etc/symbols`, never hand-written" — the claim §5.4
  retracts. Nine of the 99 come from `etc/symbols`, ninety from a hand-maintained dict.
- §16.2 annotated `'?a + ?b' ≡ '?a+?b' ≡ 'a+b'` with "whitespace is not a boundary", which
  §5.2 retracts in as many words.
- §16.2 annotated seven inputs as "(all six)".
- §16.4, the definition of the asset, **omitted the fold table** — without it the port
  cannot fold at all and cannot tell which 90 of the 99 separators are rendered
  characters. Step 1's corpus comparison cannot catch this, because both sides read the
  same asset.
- §16.4 listed the `letter`/`greek` groups of `etc/symbols` among the emitted sets; §5.2
  says they are not consulted.
- §16.4 carried `²` at 640 occurrences "in the corpus"; 3,955 over the whole corpus, 640
  over §3.3's 230,944-document namespace.
- §16.7 asked a review whether `symbol_explode` can split a symbol — a step D43 deleted —
  and about a letter-group boundary §5.2 says does not exist.
- §6.1's schema declared `[4096]f32`; D31 locks f16. The schema is what an implementer
  copies.
- §0 and §16.9 both said all three prerequisites still block the export; D33 and §12.2 say
  A is done.
- The header said the document "has still not" been reviewed adversarially. Two rounds
  have run.
- D33's caveat that §7.2's "already in the DB, 100 %" cell "is wrong until that plan has
  run" — it has run.

## Outstanding, ranked

### Would make an implementer build the wrong thing

1. **§8.1 step 5 specifies a rule §5 does not contain.** "§5's tokenizer strips one
   trailing `(_)` from an `Entity Name` condition before tokenizing … That normalisation
   is a shared asset (§5.5)." §5.1's pipeline has four steps and none strips `(_)`;
   §5.5's asset list does not carry it; §16.2 does not test it. Either specify it in §5
   and §5.5 and add a §16.2 case, or delete the claim and say where `coll(_)` is handled.
2. **§8.2's namespace naming predates D45.** It names the namespace for the data only
   (`isabelle-2025-2-afp-2026-05-13`); D45 requires the asset digest in the name and D46
   makes a mismatched component set a hard failure. §8.2 is the only place the scheme is
   specified.
3. **§8.1 step 6 emits the pre-D45 asset set** — "the shared test vector file and the
   symbol table JSON" — where D45 requires one stamped asset carrying the symbol table,
   the fold table, five character-class sets, the abbreviations, the `ISABELLE_SYMBOLS`
   file list and the Unicode version.
4. **§9.2 rests on a measurement D37 retracted.** "`?P ⟹ ?Q` returns 1 document" — D37
   records 60, and the empty-state copy was rebuilt on `?n + ?m = ?m + ?n`, measured 0.
   A whole subsection argues from the withdrawn figure.
5. **D46's failure condition names a "declared component set" the plan never locates.**
   Nothing says where the declaration lives or what it is compared against.
6. **§16.3 step 1's acceptance is "reproduces every line of §16.2"** — repairable now that
   §16.2's three retracted claims are fixed, but the dependency should be stated.

### Figures that disagree with themselves

7. **Corpus total.** §3.1 gives 1,364,990 entries / 1,353,574 entity records; §0, D5,
   §3.4 and §16.2 use the 1,362,343 family. §3.1 is the section the plan tells reviewers
   to trust and is 8,769 low. Needs a dated correction note like §3.2 and §3.4 carry.
8. **Theorem-alike records.** 1,148,833 in §3.1 and §7.2; 1,156,333 in D24, whose every
   percentage is computed against it.
9. **`⟹` document frequency.** 42 %, 42.35 % and 45.34 % across §3.3, §3.4, §3.6, §14.6
   and the companion, against two denominators, one of them unstated.
10. **Fallback-kept-token frequency** appears as 3.18 % (230,944 base), 3.81 %
    (1,362,096 base) and 3.71 % (§14.7, matching neither).
11. **Per-search cost.** §11.1b computes $0.000022 from "~20 KB returned"; D29 computes
    $0.000031 from "~200 KB". D29 is internally consistent; §11.1b is an order of
    magnitude low, and its per-day table and the "13,600 searches a day" floor inherit it.
12. **§11.1b's whole cost model runs on 1,241,679 site documents**, the count D5 reversed
    to 1,362,343. §3.3's "230,944 is 18.6 % of the real corpus" has the same base; against
    the reversed D5 it is 17.0 %.
13. **Distinct theory long names** 8,299 (§7.2) vs 8,329 (D39).
14. **Hashes the site must resolve** 9,148 (§3.2) vs 9,214 (§7.3).
15. **§3.2 says two apparent misses; §7.3 explains one.**
16. **§3.1's vector count is 110,329** (8 % coverage); §8.1's gate reports 0.65 % missing.
    A reader sizing the export from §3.1 is off by twelve times.
17. §3.1's full-coverage vector count (1,353,570) does not match its own record count
    (1,353,574).
18. Mean tokens per document 37.0 and 39.0 in adjacent lines; `::` at 9.1 % and 9.89 %
    with the sample caveat attached to the wrong line.
19. Thousands separators alternate between comma and space for the same quantity.

### Status and structure

20. §12.2's diagram omits step 3 — the only live work — and leaves B feeding nothing,
    though the prose says B blocks the export through D24's scope test.
21. §12.2's prerequisite C is "positions in the published snapshot" in prose and
    "positions carried into the rebuilt store" in the diagram. Different artefacts.
22. §12.2's closing paragraph offers the copy and mockup as available work; both are done.
    It also cites "D21-D41" where the range now runs to D46.
23. §2's preamble accounts for D1-D21 only, and does not explain why the list runs
    ascending to D20 then descending from D46.
24. The companion's §15.0 status block says "D1-D42 are settled" and lists the copy and
    the tokenizer freeze as the two unblocked pieces. The copy is done, D43-D46 exist,
    and prerequisite A is done.
25. §9's heading and preamble still assert D20 ("DEFERRED", "nothing here is to be built
    yet"); D20 is superseded by D32, which stages §9 as phase two.
26. §5.1 step 2 still calls the U+007F replacement "a stop-gap until §10 lands". It landed.
27. D37's "consequence to act on" — rebuild the empty-state page — is discharged.
28. §11.1b argues for a BM25 degradation path D35 deleted; §6.5 and §11.1 record the
    deletion, §11.1b does not.
29. D9/§9.4 say one entity page per site document; §6.1 makes `group` the page identity
    while D5's reversal makes a site document one per record.
30. §13's Q3 gives a rate D35 superseded (12/minute against 5 per 10 seconds), applies
    D29's 512-character condition cap to the 8,000-character query cap, and cites a figure
    D28 no longer contains.
31. D33 calls itself "a prerequisite of the whole of phase one" while §12.2 step 3 says
    the tokenizer freeze never depended on it.

### Cross-references

32. **§11.4 does not exist.** §11.1's instruction for when to build D35's layer 3 points
    at nothing.
33. "A reader working on the backend can skip to §10" now lands on a four-line pointer
    stub.
34. §6.6 is filed before §6.5.
35. A `site/COPY.md §3.2` citation should be §4.2.
36. §5.4 says D41 carries the stale 640; D41 was corrected and §16.4 carried it (now
    fixed). The sentence should name §16.4.
37. §16.7 leans on §15.4 without saying §15.4 is now in the companion.

### Terminology, against §1's rule of one canonical name

38. `unicode_of_ascii` and `pretty_unicode` for one function (they are aliases in the
    source; the plan should pick one).
39. "one stamped asset" (D45) against "the assets" (D41, §5.2, §16.3, §16.4). The digest
    that names the namespace is of one file, so the number matters.
40. The theory-hash registry is also "the hash-to-name table" and "the complete
    hash-to-name table".
41. `interpretation` / "explanation" / "the disclosure" / "the disclaimer" / "the
    disclosure sentence" for one field and one locked sentence.
42. `contains`/`excludes` in the interface, `includes`/`excludes` in §6.3's compilation.
43. "four panels plus a kind filter" (§0) against "five filter panels" (D22, §9.1).
44. §9.2b labels the theory panel "theory"; D22 fixes it as `Theory Name` and records that
    the bare form was considered and rejected.
45. `theorem-alike`, `name-addressed` and `universal key` are load-bearing throughout and
    absent from §1.
46. The unit of counting drifts among records, documents, expressions and entities for the
    same corpus, sometimes within a sentence. §1's `site document` is none of them.
47. §0 calls the export "one-off"; §8 requires it to be re-runnable and deterministic.
48. §8.3 still says `symbol_explode` folds CR to LF; D43 deleted the step.

### Cannot be acted on as written

49. §9.4 says to prioritise "widely-used AFP entries" for crawl budget; no field records
    popularity and the plan defines no signal.
50. §11.1's two unverified items give no procedure, and the paragraph above already
    asserts one of them as fact.
51. §6.3's `theory_subtokens` separator `"\n"` is specified as settled while §16.8 says the
    question it depends on — whether turbopuffer stores a whitespace-only element — is
    untested. Neither §8.1 nor §12.2 lists the test as a step.
52. D33 records G1 as not re-verified and does not state the command that regenerates the
    dependency table it needs.
53. §12.1's repository layout omits `site/COPY.md`, `site/design/`, `site/prototype/` and
    `site/review/`, all cited as load-bearing elsewhere.
54. Two cited plan files live at the repository root, not beside this plan as the citation
    convention implies; one is cited without its extension.
55. The companion's §15.1 sends the reader to probe scripts in a deleted scratchpad; the
    live answer is `site/prototype/corpus_probe.py`. Same at §15.3 for the prototype files.

---

# Second audit: the plan against the code and the corpus

Run 2026-08-18. Figures measured on **this machine's** store, never on `cslh19`, so a
disagreement may be snapshot age rather than a defect — the report says which it checked.
It confirms a long list of figures reproduce exactly; only the failures are recorded here.

## Errors in decisions, not just drift

**A. D43's cost claim is wrong, and materially.** It says the 17 records that lose a
subtoken are "all in phi-System theories that D24 excludes from the export". Three are
not: `AbsCFCorrect.lemma6` and `AbsCFCorrect.contour_a_class.abs_cnt_initial` are AFP
`Shivers-CFA`, which D24 **exports**, and `Matrix.matrix` is likewise an AFP entry. So
D43's cost is not confined to material the site never publishes. The decision still
stands on 3,118 refinements against 17 losses; the sentence excusing the losses does not.

**B. §16.3 step 1's acceptance test cannot pass.** It requires the production tokenizer to
produce "subtoken arrays identical to the prototype's for all 1 362 096 expressions",
compared by digest. By D43 the two **must** differ, on exactly 3,135. The step gates the
production tokenizer on agreeing with the rule §5 replaced. It also says the lift changes
the prototype "in exactly one respect" (reading classes from assets); it is two — the
other is dropping `symbol_explode`.

**C. §3.2's "0 private-use characters in `expr`" is now 1.** `IDE_CP_Core.φlemmata`
carries U+E015, U+E057, U+E028, U+E068. `name` and `interpretation` are still 0. D44's
justification survives; the number does not.

## Stale paths

- `entity_source` (§3.2) exists nowhere in `contrib/` except this document.
- `semantic_store.ML` no longer computes `Position.line_of`; it moved to
  `Tools/entity_position.ML:98` and `Tools/pide_state.ML:108,730`.
- §6.3 says `site/DESIGN_PROMPT.md`'s deliverable 5 "must lose" a notice it has already
  lost; deliverable 5 is now "An entity page".
- **D11's fix has not happened.** `Tools/pide_state.ML:553` still uses `Token.source_of`
  where D11 says it "will be fixed to `Token.unparse`", with the comment the companion's
  §10.1 calls wrong still above it. §10's "done" is true of the data, not of the cause.
- **The plan never mentions `site/review/`**, though it is committed and holds the review
  §16.7 demands. §16.7 still reads as future work, and the companion's §15.4 still says
  D33-D42 have never been reviewed.
- `site/prototype/README.md` describes "these two files", omitting `corpus_probe.py`, and
  cites §15.3, which has moved to the companion; the live build order is §16.3.

## Figures that no longer hold

Ordered by how far off they are.

- §3.1's vector store: **110,329 vectors** → **1,355,257 live** plus 7,810 tombstones.
- §3.1's max expression length **32,228** → **88,517**, off by 2.7×.
- §14.7's primed-name figures, **150,679 expressions and 41,554 names (3.05 %)** → 158,120
  and 47,766 (3.51 %) on one reading, 165,010 and 50,307 on another; **neither** gives the
  document's pair, while the same paragraph's other figures reproduce to the record. Not
  store drift — something else.
- D46's "phi-System contributes **112 symbols**" is not reconstructible from any stated
  rule: the two files contribute 185 names, ~113 appear nowhere in the store, and under
  D24 the count of symbols no *published* entity uses is 185.
- D37's subtoken frequencies: `P` **10.80 %** → 12.82 %, `a` 17.50 % → 16.55 %. Consistent
  with the figures coming from the 230,944-document namespace, which D37 does not say.
- §3.1's absolute counts are the 2026-08-09 figures throughout (1,353,574 records →
  1,362,343; theorem-alike 1,148,833 → 1,156,153; name-addressed 204,741 → 206,010).
  Percentages hold. §7.2 and §12.2 repeat them.
- §7.2's **8,299** distinct theory long names against D39's 8,329 — §7.2 is the stale half.
- §8.1's gate: 8,908 records (0.65 %) with no vector → **7,810 (0.57 %)**; "all of them
  tombstoned" holds exactly.
- §7.3's 11,415 per-theory records → 11,474; local registry 3,145 → 3,844.
- §6.1/§6.3's array sizes (expr 37.72, name 6.30) are the 230,944-document figures used
  without their denominator; whole-corpus they are 39.17 and 6.77.
- The **1,981** word-glyph-escape records (§3.4) → 1,980. One apart.

## What reproduces, so nobody re-measures it

The whole of §16.2 — **32 inputs, 0 mismatches**, and 0 mismatches *also* under a
character-level implementation of §5.2/§5.4 as now written, so no line of that table is
wrong or prototype-stale. All 11 of §5.3's relations likewise. The companion's §15.1 table
entire, including 617,652 = 45.34 %. D43's 3,135 / 3,118 / 17. D39's 8,329 and the
no-session-prefix finding. D44's 135 private-use symbols at U+E000–U+E086. The separator
class 99 = 2 + 7 + 90. `get_LETTER_SYMBOLS()` = 190, table 624 with 151 astral. §14.7's
13.20 % and 169,005 interior. Zero U+007F, zero non-NFC, 835 CR, and the escape
classification 3,562 / 77 / 1,056 / 1,078 / 3,135 / 17. §6.2's 88,798 base64-long keys
(89,137 today). D24's 17,883 (17,865 under the base-logic clause). And
`corpus_probe.py`, run unmodified from its committed location, reproduces §16.1's own
verification: `?n + ?m = ?m + ?n` → 0, `?a + ?b = ?b + ?a` → 15.

Also confirmed correct: `symbol.scala:318`'s name regex is exactly what §5.1 describes and
exactly what `unicode.py:232` now uses; `etc/symbols` line 189 is byte-for-byte what §9.3
quotes; `SUBSUP_TRANS_TABLE` is 142 entries; `conda/recipe.yaml`'s allow-list means `site/`
cannot leak.

## Prototype staleness, and its blast radius

`site/prototype/` is pre-D43 in both the ways expected: it calls `symbol_explode`, and
`_is_letter` consults the `etc/symbols` letter groups §5.2 says are not consulted.

The blast radius is **exactly the 3,135 records D43 names** — the two definitions agree on
the other 1,358,961 — so no other corpus figure in the plan is at risk from it. But the
plan treats it as current in four places: §16.2 calls it the measuring instrument for the
acceptance criteria; §16.1 mandates `corpus_probe.py` "rather than writing a new probe",
and that probe imports the pre-D43 rule; §16.3 makes it the corpus-wide oracle (finding B);
§16.7 asks a question about a deleted step. §8.3 also still explains a CR behaviour by
`symbol_explode`; the conclusion survives on a different ground.
