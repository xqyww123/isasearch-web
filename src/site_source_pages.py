r"""The source-page upload pass (SEMANTIC_SEARCH_SITE_PLAN.md §17): the rendered
tree becomes the published tree, and every namespace row gains its finished
source link.

Five steps, run as subcommands, on the machines §17.1 assigns them to:

* **scan** — the corpus scan, on the machine with the semantic DB: walks exactly
  the record set the site export publishes (`site_export.iter_shippable`, one
  filter chain for both) and writes the per-record position triples plus the
  declaring-theory evidence the map's cross-check consumes.
* **map** — on cslh19, beside the rendered tree, the authoritative registry and
  the source trees: derives every rendered page's theory long name (D52),
  builds the file→page map by one lookup over `data/theories.json` (D53, with
  the three staleness gates and the declaring-hash zero-conflict cross-check),
  and seals classification, map and positions into **one artefact whose
  content hash every later step re-checks** — no step ever reads "whichever
  table this machine happens to have".
* **publish** — the pass itself (§17.4), on cslh19: relocates the kept pages
  under their long names, rewrites every site-internal reference, passes
  site-external references through byte-identically (D50), strips
  input-dangling anchors with a WARNING each (D51), injects the needed line
  marks, merges the conflicting auxiliary copies by id-union (D49 ruling 6),
  and generates the index and the one stylesheet — all into a fresh directory
  atomically renamed into place, removed again if the pass fails, and never a
  directory it was handed.
* **gate** — the link-check gate (§17.5) over the published tree: zero misses
  on marks and references, every fragment checked, no anchor trusted;
  site-external references exempt and counted (D50).  The report's two
  standing counters — stripped input-dangling references and exempted
  site-external references — are the alarm every future data update is
  checked by.
* **patch** — on the machine with the turbopuffer key: one `patch_rows` run
  writing `source_link` onto every row of the live namespace (§17.6, D49
  ruling 3).  turbopuffer ignores a patch to an id that does not exist, and
  the run counts the namespace before and after to prove no row was created.

The artefact carries the recipe, not the string (Q4, 2026-08-23): per-record
`(document id, file index, line)` triples ride beside the file→page map, and
`source_links` composes each finished href at use time — one function, so a
row's link can never disagree with the map it came from.  `needed_lines` is
likewise derived from the same triples, so the marks the publisher injects and
the lines the links point at are the same set by construction.
