# A public semantic-search site over the Isabelle semantic DB

Draft 3, 2026-08-12. This document is the design agreed in conversation on
2026-08-09 and revised on 2026-08-12; it is written to be reviewed
adversarially, and **two rounds have run**: a full review on 2026-08-13 covering
the plan up to roughly D32, and a narrow review of §5 and D41 on 2026-08-14 whose
evidence is committed under `site/review/` (§16.7). D43-D46 postdate both and have
not been reviewed. Draft 2 recorded the decisions
D13–D19, corrected the treatment of theories for theorem-alike entities (§7,
which draft 1 got wrong), and added the Fireworks latency measurements (§3.5)
that moved the region decision. Draft 3 records D21 — the collapse of the two
expression-matching mechanisms into one (§5.4, §6.1, §6.3) — withdraws the
open question Q5 and the false statement that produced it, and updates the
implementation status below.

Draft 3 also corrects **three factual errors** found on 2026-08-12, changing no
decision — D1–D21 stand unaltered. Each correction is marked *Draft 3
correction* where it applies. In short: the theory-hash registry was reported as
9.9 % complete and in need of an Isabelle enumeration run (§3.2, §7.3), when in
fact `cslh19`'s copy already resolves 100 % of the persistent hashes that ship —
the earlier figure was measured on the wrong machine; §12.2's step 2 changes
accordingly from *build* to *publish*; and D19's stated premise, that the three
copies of the database were in sync, was false.

**Implementation status.** The U+007F repair (D12, §10) is **done**: **zero of
`cslh19`'s 1,343,793 entity records carry U+007F**, re-verified on the authority
2026-08-19, and zero of this machine's 1,362,343 did on 2026-08-12. `ENTITY_POSITION_PLAN.md` is
**done**, and so is getting its result everywhere: **1,327,426 of 1,343,793 records
(98.8 %) carry an entity position on this machine**, measured 2026-08-20, the snapshot
having been republished from `cslh19` on 2026-08-19 and again on 2026-08-20. The
figure this document gave until then — 1,092,855 (80.2 %) on `cslh19` only, 8,306
here — described the state before those republishes. **All three of §12.2's
prerequisites are now done**: A the key repair (D33, 2026-08-18), B the theory-hash
registry and C the positions in the published snapshot (both 2026-08-20). `site/COPY.md` and
`site/design/IsaSearch.dc.html` exist and are authoritative for the interface copy;
`site/prototype/` holds the measured tokenizer prototype, which is **pre-D43** and
whose blast radius is stated in §16.1; and `site/review/` holds the evidence of the
§5 review that §16.7 required. Everything else in §12.2 is
unstarted: no tokenizer module, no site export, no Worker, no served site.

Orientation for a reader arriving with no other context: §2 is the settled
decisions (do not reopen), §3 is the measured evidence every decision rests on,
§13 is the open questions, §14 is what was considered and rejected. Citations
name **functions and files, not line numbers** — this is a shared working tree
and line numbers move (the convention `VECTOR_INVALIDATION_PLAN.md` and
`ENTITY_POSITION_PLAN.md` both adopted).

**Where the numbers were measured.** Every corpus figure in this document was taken
on **this** machine's copy of the database unless it says otherwise, and this
machine is not the authority — `cslh19` is (D19), and it publishes to Hugging Face.
The figures re-measured on 2026-08-19 are stamped with that date; the earlier ones,
stamped 2026-08-09 or 2026-08-12, predate the D33 key repair and the entity-position
backfill and are kept only where the older reading is itself the point. A figure
about a *document frequency* always names the population it was counted over —
either the whole corpus or §3.3's 230,944-document test namespace — because those
two denominators differ by six times and an unlabelled percentage from the second
has been mistaken for the first three times already.

**Relationship to `ENTITY_POSITION_PLAN.md`**: that plan (approved, being
implemented as of 2026-08-09 19:21 — `position` is already the 13th record
field) adds an **entity position** to every record and backfills the ~1.35 M
existing records. This plan **consumes it and requires no change to it**. Draft
1 proposed folding a declaring theory for theorem-alike entities into its
backfill; D13 withdraws that — the concept does not apply to them (§7.1). The
only thing this plan needs from it is the source link on entity pages (§9.4).

## 0. Summary

Publish a web site — **`isasearch`** (D30) — that lets anyone search
Isabelle/HOL and AFP entities over the ~1.35 M entities already in the semantic
DB. A search is always a **semantic query**: natural language, ranked by cosine
similarity of Qwen3-Embedding-8B vectors, fused with BM25 over the English
interpretation by reciprocal rank fusion (D29). A required query, never a bare
filter (D7).

It may be narrowed by **syntactic conditions**, every one of them
`contains` / `excludes` matched as an adjacent ordered run of **Isabelle
subtokens** (D21, §5.4), in five filter panels (D22):

1. **Entity Name** — the entity's own name;
2. **Expression** — the printed entity expression;
3. **Theory Name** — the associated theories. What that means differs by kind
   and is stated in the interface (D14, D15, §7.2, §9.2b);
4. **All** — any of the three above, compiled to an `Or` (§6.3);
5. **Kind** — a chip group, nothing selected by default; an empty selection
   restricts nothing (D29 as amended 2026-08-24).

Serving is fully serverless: Cloudflare Pages + Worker for the front end,
turbopuffer for vectors *and* filtering, Fireworks for the query embedding. No
server to operate. A **site export** derives the published index from the semantic
DB; it runs whenever the data or the tokenizer asset changes, and §8 requires it to
be re-runnable and deterministic.

## 1. Glossary — canonical names, never paraphrased

These are the names **this document** uses, and they name record kinds as the
database spells them. Four of them are **not** what a visitor sees: the Kind chip
labels the user approved on 2026-08-14 are `Named theorems` for `Theorem collection`
and `Case split` for `Case split rule`, and `site/COPY.md` §11 is authoritative for
those and for every other visitor-facing string. Build the chip group from `COPY.md`,
never from this table.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **entity** | One record in `semantics.lmdb`: a constant, type, class, locale, method, theorem collection, theorem, or derived rule. Never "item", "object", "fact". |
| **entity expression** | The `expr` field of the record. For theorem-alike kinds it is the proposition; for constants it is the type; for the five source-text kinds (`TYPE`, `CLASS`, `LOCALE`, `METHOD`, `THEOREM_COLLECTION`) it is the declaration's source text. |
| **declaring theory** | The theory whose source declares the entity, named by its **session-qualified long name** (e.g. `HOL-Library.Sorted_Sort`). **Applies only to name-addressed entities.** Theorem-alike entities are content-addressed and have no declaring theory in this data model (§7). Never "owning theory", "home theory". |
| **constituent theories** | The `theory_constituents` field: the theories of the **constants occurring in the entity expression**, as `(long name, 16-byte hash)` pairs. Present on every theorem-alike and experience record. **Not** a declaring theory. |
| **the associated theories** | The set of theories a *site document* is filtered by (D14): its declaring theory when name-addressed, its constituent theories when theorem-alike. **This exact phrase, always** — never "related theories", "relevant theories", "theory domains", or any other paraphrase. The word "domain" is specifically excluded: `dom`, `Dom` and `domain` name unrelated Isabelle concepts (the domain of a map or relation, and HOLCF's `domain` command) in about 27,500 entities of this very corpus, and "domain" also reads as "subject area", a plausible but wrong meaning. |
| **theorem-alike entity** | A record of kind `Theorem`, `Introduction rule`, `Elimination rule`, `Induction rule` or `Case split rule`. Such a record is **content-addressed**: its key is the statement's digest under an XOR pseudo-theory prefix, so it has no declaring theory (D13, §7.1). 1,137,981 of 1,343,793 records on `cslh19`, 84.7 %. Never "theorem-like", "a fact", "a lemma record". |
| **name-addressed entity** | A record of kind `Constant`, `Type`, `Class`, `Locale`, `Theorem collection` or `Proof method`. Its universal key carries its declaring theory's 16-byte hash as the prefix, so the declaring theory is recoverable from the key alone once §7.3's table is available. 199,044 records, 14.8 %, on `cslh19`. The two categories partition the corpus apart from the 6,768 `EXPERIENCE` records, which are never published. |
| **universal key** | A record's key in `semantics.lmdb`, constructed by `Isabelle_RPC_Host.universal_key`: a 16-byte theory-or-XOR prefix, one kind byte, and the addressing tail that kind uses. Never "record key", "entity id". The turbopuffer document id is a 128-bit hash **of** the universal key, not the key itself (§6.2). |
| **the tokenizer** | The single normalisation described in §5, applied identically to stored text and to user queries. Never "the analyser", "the lexer", "the splitter". Its reference implementation of symbol conversion is `Isabelle_RPC_Host.pretty_unicode`; this document names that function and never `unicode_of_ascii`, which is a one-line alias of it in the same module. |
| **token** | One output element of the tokenizer. |
| **subtoken** | One output element of the second-level split described in §5.4. Under D21 this is the only level that is indexed or queried. |
| **interpretation** | The `interpretation` field of the record: the English text a language model wrote from the formal statement. **This word, always**, for the field and for what a card shows — never "explanation", "description" or "summary" in this document. (`site/COPY.md` may and does choose a different word for visitors, who do not read this plan; that is its call, not a second name for the field.) |
| **the machine-generated disclosure** | The one locked sentence pair that must appear wherever an interpretation is shown, fixed by D30 as amended and D40 and reproduced verbatim in `site/COPY.md` §4.2. **This exact phrase for it** — never "the disclaimer", "the disclosure sentence" or "the notice". |
| **site export** | The batch job (§8) that turns the semantic DB into the turbopuffer namespace and its attributes. Never "publish", "sync", "ingest". |
| **site document** | One turbopuffer document, one per exported *record* (D5, reversed 2026-08-13). Records sharing a `(name, entity expression)` are collapsed into one card in the response, not in the index. |
| **entity page** | The server-rendered permanent page for one site document (§9.4). |

**The unit of counting is the record**, and it is worth stating because four words
have been used for it. On `cslh19`, which is the authority (D19; measured
2026-08-19), there are **1,343,793** entity records; each exported one becomes
exactly one **site document** (D5 as reversed); **1,336,979** of them carry an
entity expression and **1,343,793** carry a name, so a figure about expressions has
a different denominator from a figure about names; and **1,337,025** are exportable
before D24's scope test, the difference being the 6,768 `EXPERIENCE` records.
(Until 2026-08-19 this paragraph gave this machine's 1,362,343 / 1,362,096 / 180 —
a different generation of the store, see §3's preamble.) "Entity", "document" and "expression" are not interchangeable units in this
document, and a count that does not say which one it means is a defect.

## 2. LOCKED decisions

D1–D20 were taken by the user on 2026-08-09, D21 on 2026-08-12, D22–D31 on
2026-08-12/13, D32–D42 on 2026-08-13/14, and D43–D46 on 2026-08-17/18. Do not
re-litigate; ask before deviating.

**The list is not in one order, and that is deliberate.** It opens with D1–D20 in
ascending order, as they were first written, and then continues from **D46
downwards** to D21, so that the newest decision is the first one a reader meets
after the original twenty. Two of the early entries are struck through in place
rather than deleted — D20, superseded by D32, and D28, cancelled the same day it
was taken — because §9 and §12.2 were written under D20 and §11.1b under D28, and a
reader of those sections needs to find the decision that used to govern them.

- **D1** — **turbopuffer** hosts both the vectors and the syntactic filtering.
  Cloudflare Vectorize was rejected: it supports no substring matching and no
  vector-ID allow-list (§14.1).
- **D2** — **no first-order pattern matching.** Dropped from scope. Its removal
  is what makes the site serverless: matching a user-written pattern would
  require Isabelle's parser at query time (§14.2).
- **D3** — **no reranker.** Retrieval is the bi-encoder alone. The cross-encoder
  `qwen3-reranker-8b` path stays off; `_get_reranker` returning `None` already
  degrades `lookup` to pure kNN, so no code change is needed.
- **D4** — **the query loses `?`.** The tokenizer discards `?` on both sides, so
  the stored `sorted_wrt R ?xs` and the user's `sorted_wrt R xs` match.
  Consequence: schematic and free variables become indistinguishable to search.
- **D5** (2026-08-09, **reversed 2026-08-13**) — **there is no merge.** One site
  document per *record*, carrying that record's own universal key, vector,
  interpretation and single `kind`. Cross-kind duplicates are collapsed **in
  the response, after ranking**, into one card whose kinds are the union (of
  the members that reached the result set — D38's stored group-wide union was
  withdrawn 2026-08-25) and whose interpretation is **the highest-scoring
  member's**. **What counts as a duplicate is the user's golden standard of
  2026-08-25:** two records are one entity iff both are theorem-alike —
  32-byte universal key whose tag byte (the 17th) is `THEOREM` 0x02,
  `INTRODUCTION_RULE` 0x12, `ELIMINATION_RULE` 0x22, `INDUCTION_RULE` 0x32 or
  `CASE_SPLIT_RULE` 0x42 — and their keys agree in every byte but the tag. A
  name-addressed record never merges. Until that day the relation was the
  stored `group` column, a hash of `(name, entity expression)`, and it was
  wrong both ways, measured on the local store (same generation as the live
  index): it merged 25 335 groups whose members' keys differ beyond the tag —
  e.g. `Overapproximation.avars_aval`, the same lemma proved in the AFP entries
  `IMP_Noninterference` and `IMP_Noninterference_Extension`, two records with
  two source positions, which one card cannot show — and it split 4 919 pairs
  whose keys differ only in the tag but whose names differ
  (`PRecFun2.PrimRec1'p.snd` / `PRecFun2.PrimRec1'p.intros(4)`, one fact under
  two names). Under the standard there are 105 768 collapse classes, all of
  them Theorem-plus-rule, 212 310 records, and **1 230 467 entities** in the
  live corpus. The Worker computes the class from the row's `key` (tag byte
  masked), so no re-export was needed; the `group` column is no longer read
  and is dropped at the next export. The original decision merged at export time; it
  was reversed because nothing could say which member supplied the id, the
  vector or the interpretation, and all three genuinely differ (the kind is
  inside the embedded text via `pretty_print`). Collapsing after ranking makes
  that choice non-arbitrary: the ranking picks the representative.
  Consequences, all accepted: the namespace grows ~9.7 % (1,362,343 records
  against 1,241,679 merged documents), which at D31's f16 is **11.16 GB of vectors
  against 10.17 GB**, a difference of about one gigabyte and invisible beside a
  full-length query's embedding cost (§11.1b recomputes the whole cost model on the
  1,362,343; the ~11.9 / ~10.83 GB this sentence used to give were the same
  calculation with a namespace overhead folded in and did not match §11.1b's own
  arithmetic); a
  200-row fetch collapses to ~182 distinct entities on average, so D29's "200
  results" reads as **at most** 200 entities and there is no over-fetch; and the
  `kind` filter becomes an unambiguous single-valued test instead of the
  any-of/all-of question a multi-valued `kinds` would have raised (§13, F18).

- **D6** — **mid-identifier substrings are not searchable.** Searching `orted`
  will not find `sorted_wrt`. Queries that break at `_` or `.` boundaries are
  served by the subtoken field (§5.4).
- **D7** — **no filter-only browsing.** A semantic query is required; an empty
  query is rejected rather than falling back to some other ordering.
- **D8** — **runs of ASCII symbolic characters merge into one token**
  (Isabelle's `sym_ident` rule): `::` is one token, not two colons.
- **D9** — **entity pages exist**, server-rendered, **one per record** — one per
  site document, addressed by its universal key, base64url, at
  `/entity/<key>` (the user's choice, 2026-08-25: the key is the semantic
  DB's own identity, so any tool holding a key can form the URL without a
  lookup; the Worker derives the document id from it — §6.2's BLAKE2b-128,
  ported to the Worker and checked against Python-generated vectors) — for
  search-engine discoverability (§9.4). **Amended by the user, 2026-08-25.** From
  2026-08-19 to that day it said "one per `group`", on the argument that
  cross-kind twin records of one statement would otherwise make duplicate pages.
  Measured 2026-08-25 (60 Introduction-rule groups sampled): the twins carry
  **different** interpretations, each written from its own kind's point of view,
  and each its own vector; a page per `group` would have to choose one to show
  or show both, and the user rejected hiding either ("强烈反对"). One page per
  record shows exactly what its card showed — the collapse (D5) already makes
  the highest-ranked member the card's representative, so the card links to
  that member's page and the page needs no rule of its own for the
  interpretation or for the vector its related entities come from. Duplicate
  pages and a 1.34 M-URL sitemap in place of 1.21 M were ruled no problem. No
  sibling list on the page (the user, 2026-08-25).
- **D10** — **displayed fields are the entity name and the entity expression.**
  The interpretation is present but collapsed by default.
- **D11** — **`Token.source_of` in `pide_state.ML` is a defect and will be
  fixed** to `Token.unparse` (§10.1). It is our own file, not part of the
  Isabelle distribution.

  **Done, 2026-08-19.** `command_spans_of_text` in `Tools/pide_state.ML` now calls
  `Token.unparse`, and the comment above it — which asserted that `source_of` returns
  each token's original text, the assertion the companion's §10.1 disproves by
  measurement — is corrected. It had stood since §10's repair, so §10's "done" was a
  statement about the **data** only: D12 repaired the 238 affected records one at a
  time, and zero carry U+007F today, but until now a fresh collection run over a
  theory with a delimited token could write the character back through the fallback
  path. §5.1's pipeline step 2 stays regardless, because a visitor can paste a
  U+007F into the query box.

  **Why the change is safe for the offsets, which is the non-obvious part.** The two
  offsets `command_spans_of_text` returns come from `Token.range_of` and never from
  the string's length, but `Isabelle_Semantic_Embedding/hover.py` adds `start_off` to
  an index it finds *inside* the returned source, so the source must stay
  symbol-aligned with the file. It does: `Symbol_Pos.DEL` is one DEL per consumed
  **symbol** — which is what made §10.2's repair reconstruct 238 of 238 with zero
  ambiguity by matching exactly one Isabelle symbol per DEL — and `Token.unparse`
  writes exactly those symbols back (`"…"`, `` `…` ``, `\<open>…\<close>`, `(*…*)`),
  leaving every other token as its stored text. Read out of `Pure/Isar/token.ML` and
  `Pure/General/symbol_pos.ML` rather than measured: `quote_str` emits only the three
  escape forms `scan_str` accepts, so encode∘decode is the identity. The one spelling
  that would shrink is a string literal writing a **non-control** character as a
  `\NNN` char code, which re-emits as the bare character; nothing in the corpus does
  that.
- **D12** — **the 238 records containing U+007F are repaired surgically**, by
  reading the true text back out of the theory source, and the repaired DB is
  re-uploaded to Hugging Face (§10.2).
- **D13** — **theorem-alike entities have no declaring theory** and none is to be
  invented for them. They are content-addressed; their key prefix is an XOR
  pseudo-theory and availability is governed by their constituent theories. An
  earlier draft of this plan treated the absence as a 14.7 % data gap to be
  filled; that framing was wrong and is withdrawn (§7).
- ~~**D14**~~ — **superseded by D55 (2026-08-26)**: the theory filter matched
  constituent theories for theorem-alike entities and the declaring theory for
  name-addressed ones. Its own reasoning survives it — letting theorems pass
  unfiltered pins the candidate set at 84.9–85.0 % whatever is filtered, and
  excluding them hides 85 % of the corpus (§7.2) — but it assumed those were
  the only two alternatives to matching constituents. D55 takes the third: give
  a theorem a defining theory, derived from its source position.
- ~~**D15**~~ — **superseded by D55 (2026-08-26)**: with D14 gone there is no
  difference in meaning left to state, and COPY §3.4's note is deleted. Its
  principle stands wherever a difference does remain: state it plainly, never
  hide it, never paper over it with a mode selector.
- **D16** — **the site lives in this repository**: the site export as a module of
  the Python package, the web application under `site/` (§12.1).
- **D17** — **the domain is `isabelle-semantics.qiyuan.me`.**
- **D18** — **every region-bearing component goes in North America**, the
  turbopuffer namespace included, co-located with the Fireworks origin so that
  Cloudflare Smart Placement can put the Worker near both (§6.4). The user's words
  were "那我建议把所有的 regions 全放在北美" — *all* the regions, so this binds any
  later component that acquires a region or a jurisdiction (a Durable Object's home,
  a KV or D1 jurisdiction), not only the namespace this decision used to name alone.

  **Extended 2026-08-25 (user-ruled): Smart Placement governs `/source/*` too.**
  Placement is per Worker, not per route, and §17.8 put the published tree on
  the same Worker as the search API, so a source page is fetched by the Worker
  in North America rather than at the visitor's edge. The user accepted this
  over splitting `/source/*` into a second Worker: the zone cache rule serves
  the hot path at the visitor's edge, and a cold page pays one round trip.
- **D19** — **the U+007F repair runs on this machine and Hugging Face is
  uploaded from here.** Premise given by the user: this machine, `cslh19` and
  Hugging Face are currently in sync.

  **Draft 3 correction — the premise was false and the work took another
  route.** The three were not in sync: this machine and the published snapshot
  differed by roughly 1.24 M vectors. What actually happened on 2026-08-11/12 is
  that this machine published first, `cslh19` pulled and merged (a merge that
  needed a new tool, `merge_snapshot.py`, because `cslh19` held vectors the
  snapshot lacked and a plain extraction would have destroyed them), and the
  snapshot was then republished **from `cslh19`**. The repair itself did run
  here, and it is done. `cslh19` is now the authority: it publishes to Hugging
  Face, and every other machine syncs from there.
- **D20** — ~~the web application is deferred~~ — **superseded by D32 on
  2026-08-13.** Kept for the record because §9 and §12.2 were written under it.
  Original text: Work proceeds on the data side
  only: the repair (§10), the theory-hash registry (§7.3), the tokenizer (§5), the
  site export (§8), the turbopuffer namespace (§6), and the Worker's search API
  (§11.1's rate limiting included). §9 stays in this document as the agreed
  design but is **not** to be built yet, and the questions it raises need no
  answer to unblock anything.
- **D54** (2026-08-23) — **the gate's zero-miss clause splits by fragment
  provenance.** The first real gate run found §17.5's premise incomplete: a
  missing fragment can be broken-by-us, but it can also be broken-by-the-
  renderer — the rendered tree itself carries **106** `offset_…` fragment
  references (all of that one shape, none an entity name; 77 of them into
  `HOL-Real_Asymp.Multiseries_Expansion_Bounds`) whose target pages never
  received the id, verified in the input before any transform.  The ruling:
  a fragment this pipeline **composed or injected** — a row link's `#L<n>`,
  a needed mark — keeps the zero-miss hard requirement; a fragment
  **inherited** from the rendered pages is still checked, every one, but a
  miss is counted and reported instead of failed — the reader lands at the
  top of the right page, D47's silent harmless degradation, and blocking
  publication on the renderer's own omission would park the pipeline behind
  an upstream bug forever.  The count joins D50's and D51's as the alarm
  family's **third standing number**, baseline 106.  Stripping those anchors
  was considered and rejected: the target page is right, and destroying a
  nine-tenths-good link is worse than a top-of-page landing.

  **Amended 2026-08-24 — the twin defences (user-approved after adversarial
  verification).** The tolerance is no longer open-ended: an inherited miss
  is tolerated only when **both** defences pass. Defence one is the anchored
  shape predicate `^offset_\d+\.\.\d+$` — anchored, never a prefix test, so
  a theory or entity whose name begins with `offset_` cannot ride through.
  Defence two is membership in the frozen baseline
  `site/expected-counters.json` (the 106 (page, fragment) pairs, reported as
  "106 distinct fragments over 425 references"; one fragment is referenced
  253×). A missing or unreadable baseline file fails the gate **closed**.
  The baseline moves only through `gate --update-counters`, which refuses a
  pair failing the shape predicate, refuses to run while any other gate
  failure is outstanding, warns about and prunes stale entries, and
  (recommended, adopted) cross-checks each newly tolerated pair against the
  rendered tree to confirm the miss is the input's own. Any mismatch of the
  three standing counters — D50, D51, D54 — now **fails** the gate instead
  of being logged. Bookkeeping ruled with it: a page claimed by both
  provenance buckets counts once (inherited −= own). Stated plainly as a
  limitation: at a corpus regeneration the baseline degrades to a wholesale
  replacement, and defence one — the anchored shape — is what survives
  regenerations.
- **D53** (2026-08-23) — **the `.thy` resolver is a table lookup over
  `data/theories.json`; the three-step resolver is retired unimplemented.**
  The user rejected resolving file→theory identity through entity keys and
  heuristics when a direct correspondence should exist — and it does:
  `data/theories.json` (long name → source path, the umbrella builds' own
  driving input, produced by the repository's static Isabelle-side extractor)
  inverts injectively after the twin-alias fold and was measured to cover
  **9,784 of 9,784** position files with zero conflicts against the
  declaring-hash evidence and zero resolved names lacking a page. §17.3 is
  rewritten around it; the declaring-hash route is demoted to a mandatory
  zero-conflict cross-check; the shared-base-name tie-break question (115
  files) dies unasked. Freshness discipline: regenerated with every corpus
  generation — and enforced by the map step's three staleness gates
  (coverage, hash agreement, page existence), so a stale table cannot ship.
  Up-to-dateness and completeness were verified for this generation: all
  paths exist on disk, the 110 post-dump `.thy` edits are the in-build-window
  patch batch (path→name unaffected; content identical across machines), the
  rendered tree's 10,595 derived names and both umbrella theory lists are
  covered in full.
- **D52** (2026-08-23) — **the published page name is the theory long name,
  derived at classification time; D49 ruling 1's flat URL stands.** The
  adversarial code review found the defect that forced this ruling: the
  renderer names a page by `print_short` — the theory's **base** name when it
  is presented in its own session, the full long name only under a foreign
  session (`document_info.scala`) — so the real tree holds 280 base-named
  pages (HOL 115, HOL-Library 148, Pure 3, and the 17 global theories'
  pages), and code that reads the stem as the long name silently loses
  16.6 % of needed pairs and maps 103 distribution files onto same-base-named
  AFP pages. The ruling: the pass derives each page's long name and publishes
  `/source/<derived long name>.html` — §17.2's URL becomes true by
  construction rather than aspiration, and page-name uniqueness now rests on
  long-name uniqueness instead of one render's measured stem distinctness
  (609 registry base names are shared by 2+ long names; a future re-render
  could collide stems). **The derivation rule**, verified exhaustively
  against the real tree × the full registry (10,597 × 10,594; zero
  collisions, zero double-hits, zero records losing their link):
  1. a stem containing `.` **is** the long name — a theorem, not a
     heuristic: `Long_Name` makes a dot in a base name impossible, so a
     dotted stem proves foreign-session presentation and `print_short` = the
     full name;
  2. a dotless stem resolves to `<session dir>.<stem>` when the registry
     holds that name (261 pages), else to the bare `stem` itself (the 17
     global theories); both-hit ambiguity was measured at zero, and the
     **two** pages resolving to neither (`Pure/Pure/ML_Bootstrap`,
     `Pure/Pure/Sessions` — zero entity ids, referenced only by their
     dropped session index) are dropped and counted.  (Corrected 2026-08-23:
     an earlier count said four, wrongly assuming the dotted-stem branch also
     consults the registry — it does not, by design: a dotted stem *is* the
     long name by `Long_Name`'s theorem, so the two `Pure-ex.*` pages publish
     under their stems, harmlessly — no position resolves to them and nothing
     links them.)
  Amendment ratified with the rule: a registry name of shape `X.X` that
  derives no page falls back to the bare page `X` — the global-theory
  presentation of the same theory; `HOL-CSP.HOL-CSP` is the one such name
  today. Independent oracle: entity-anchor ids carry the theory's base name
  and agree on 9,893 of the 9,897 pages that have ids at all, the four
  exceptions being imports-only theories with no own entities.
- **D51** (2026-08-23) — **input-dangling references are stripped, alarmed and
  reported.** The renderer itself emits links to pages it never writes: it
  writes a page per auxiliary blob only when the blob produced markup, but
  links every `Markup.Path` file regardless, so a binary blob yields a
  dangling `<a>` (measured: exactly one tree-wide today —
  `PAPP_Impossibility.PAPP_Impossibility_Base_Case.html` referencing
  `sat_data/papp_impossibility.grat.xz.html`, which does not exist in the
  rendered tree). The ruling: **a reference whose resolved target does not
  exist in the rendered tree is input-dangling — the pass strips the `<a>`
  element, keeping its text (the page reads identically, those words just
  stop being clickable), prints one WARNING per strip naming the page and
  the target, and lists every strip in the publish report; the gate restates
  the count.** This is a general rule keyed on the input, not a patch for one
  file: any future render's new dangling blobs get the same treatment with no
  code change. It is sharply distinct from a target that exists in the
  rendered tree but is missing from the map — that stays a hard error, since
  a link the pass itself would break must never be papered over. The alarm
  discipline (user-set, 2026-08-23): the publish report carries two standing
  counters — stripped input-dangling references (D51) and exempted
  site-external references (D50) — so a data update is checked by reading two
  numbers: a jump in the first means the upstream render grew new broken
  links, a jump in the second means someone wrote a URL shape worth a look.
  Today's baselines: 1 and 232.  The report lives inside the published tree
  (a tree without its report is unrepresentable, and the gate cross-checks
  its counters and its artefact hash) and therefore ships publicly; the user
  ruled (2026-08-23) that it is **exempt** from §17.2's umbrella-name
  prohibition — its path lists carry raw rendered paths.
- **D50** (2026-08-23) — **the site-external reference class.** The rendered
  tree contains author-written external links: the `\<^url>` document
  antiquotation becomes a verbatim `<a href="…">` in the page (its single
  producer is `document_antiquotations.ML`, rendered unconditionally by
  `browser_info.scala`), and the real tree carries 232 such references on 129
  pages. §17.4/§17.5's original resolve-or-die rule can never be satisfied by
  them, so publish aborted on the first such page. The ruling, verified by an
  exhaustive census of every `href`/`src`/`url()` value in the tree before it
  was made: **a reference whose value begins with a URI scheme — matching
  `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9+.\-]*:` — or with `//` is site-external; the pass emits
  it byte-identically (not split at `#`, not resolved, not looked up), and the
  gate exempts it from the existence and fragment checks, counting it in the
  report instead.** One shared predicate serves the rewriter, the CSS
  rewriter and the gate, applied to the whole value before any fragment
  split. What makes it sound: `:` is structurally illegal in every Isabelle
  path element (`Path.illegal_char`) and hence in every session, theory and
  auxiliary-file name, so no site-internal reference can ever match the
  predicate — zero false positives by construction, and the census found zero
  scheme-less or protocol-relative external values, zero root-absolute and
  zero empty references tree-wide. The count is reported because `\<^url>`
  validates nothing: a future scheme-less external URL would read as internal
  and fail loudly, and a jump in the exempted count is the cheap tripwire for
  URL-shaped surprises. This narrows D49 ruling 4's "anything referenced but
  absent is a hard error" to site-internal references — external targets were
  never the published tree's to serve, and D47's no-external-links stance
  governs the links *we* emit on cards, not hyperlinks AFP authors wrote
  inside their own prose.
- **D49** (2026-08-21) — **the six rulings of §17's adversarial review round.**
  §17's first draft went through a 2-turn adversarial debate (two independent
  reviewers, correctness and elegance lenses, every claim measured against the
  real rendered tree and the real corpus; low-quality and refuted findings
  discarded in the second turn). The surviving findings and the review's
  reconciled numbers live in §17 itself; the user ruled on the six proposals
  the round produced, all six adopted:

  1. **The URL is flat**: `/source/<theory long name>.html#L<line>` — no
     session directory level. Basis: all 10,597 theory-page stems are distinct
     tree-wide, and 17 registry long names have no session component at all, so
     the session slot had no value for them.
  2. **Resolution happens once, at export time, and each row carries its
     finished source link** (a `source_link` string attribute: the complete
     href, `#L<line>` included, empty string meaning D42's absent form). This
     retires D47's Worker-side basename matching, whose real link coverage the
     review measured at **86.58 % (169,847 records unresolvable)** against the
     98.8 % D42 advertises — D42's figure is the coverage of *positions*,
     which the retired rule could not turn into links for 12.70 % of records.
     Under this ruling coverage becomes 99.28 %, and the link-check gate
     compares the literal strings the site will emit.
  3. **The live namespace gets the column by patch, not re-export.**
     turbopuffer's `patch_rows` writes only the named keys, leaves vectors
     untouched, may introduce a new attribute (null on untouched rows — but
     every row is patched), and bills by patched size: ~100 MB of attribute
     data instead of a 29 GB re-export.
  4. **The inventory rule is declared-classes plus proof-by-reference**: a
     short declared list of what is published; anything *referenced* by a
     published page but absent is a hard error the gate proves against
     reality; anything present but unreferenced is dropped and counted. This
     replaces §17's original "anything else → hard error", which the review
     showed refuses 398 real files on its first run.
  5. **The renderer's 34 index pages are dropped and we generate our own**:
     one `/source/index.html` listing every published theory page, grouped by
     session, built from the same file→page map the pass already holds.
     Side effect the review liked: the generated index references every
     theory page, so ruling 4's gate clause becomes a full existence check
     for free.
  6. **Auxiliary pages deduplicate by id-union merge**: one page per symbolic
     path; the 12 content-conflicting copies (differing only in entity-anchor
     ids, byte-identical otherwise) merge their id sets, so none of the
     266,134 fragment references into auxiliary pages breaks; the gate stops
     trusting any fragment and checks them all.

     **Amendment to ruling 6** (2026-08-23, from the implementation review;
     user-approved). The ruling's parenthesis — "the 12 content-conflicting
     copies (differing only in entity-anchor ids, byte-identical otherwise)"
     — was measured again against the real tree and is **wrong**. Twelve
     symbolic paths still conflict, but in three ways, not one: **eight**
     differ only in entity-anchor id *values*, as ruled; **three**
     (`$AFP/Case_Labeling/util.ML`, `~~/src/HOL/Library/Tools/smt_word.ML`,
     `~~/src/HOL/Library/Tools/word_lib.ML`) also differ in the `<title>` and
     `<h1>` file-name text, because the renderer names the file relative to
     the session presenting it; **one** (`~~/src/Provers/splitter.ML`, line
     490) differs in element *structure* — an `entity_def` span present in
     one copy and absent in the other, which also re-splits the surrounding
     span run. Two of them (`smt_word.ML`, `word_lib.ML`) further carry
     different cross-reference targets: one copy links `HOL-Library.Word`,
     the other `Zip_Benchmarks.Word` — two different published pages for the
     same entity, both of which exist and both of which carry the fragment.
     The invariant that *does* hold across all twelve, measured: **with
     `<title>` and `<h1>` blanked and all markup erased, the text is
     identical and the line counts are equal.** The ruling therefore
     becomes: *auxiliary copies of one symbolic path must agree line-for-line
     in text once the title and heading are set aside; the published page is
     the copy whose title names the symbolic path (ties broken by sorted
     rendered location), carrying the id-union of all copies; any other
     difference stops the pass.* The measured baselines move with it:
     **1,139** symbolic paths from **1,165** rendered copies (§17.2's
     1,399/1,466 was stale).

     **Amended again, 2026-08-24.** The merged auxiliary page's `<title>` and
     `<h1>` are rewritten to the symbolic path — the page names the file it
     renders, not the session that happened to render it — and the tolerance
     compares copies with the heading elements' text canonicalised rather
     than exempting any line that contains one.

     The base copy is no longer chosen by a rule. After canonicalisation the
     copies are compared byte-wise. A group whose copies are all identical
     merges with no choice to make. A group with any surviving divergence is
     resolved only by an explicit entry in the committed choice table
     `site/aux-base-choices.json`, mapping the symbolic path to the rendered
     session directory whose copy is published. A divergent group absent from
     the table is a hard error naming every copy and a divergence summary; an
     entry naming a copy that no longer exists, or a group that no longer
     diverges, is equally a hard error — the table is an exact mirror of the
     tree, and every choice in it is a reviewed human ruling, never a
     heuristic. The table is repository-internal input; session directory
     names in it never reach published output.

     Measured 2026-08-24 on the real tree: 22 multi-copy groups; 10 identical
     after canonicalisation; 11 divergent — nine `src/Provers/` and
     `src/Tools/` files loaded by both HOL and FOL (the table picks the HOL
     rendering, the context this site's data lives in), and
     `smt_word.ML`/`word_lib.ML`, whose umbrella copies record the Zippy
     benchmark's re-load of the same physical file and link `Word.word` to
     `Zip_Benchmarks.Word`, an unrelated AFP file, where the distribution's
     own copies link `HOL-Library.Word` (the table picks `HOL/HOL-Library`).
- **D48** (2026-08-21) — **fusion is server-side, and no relevance number is
  displayed anywhere.** §16.8's measurement showed turbopuffer's `rerank_by:
  ["RRF"]` drops the per-leg scores, so the vector leg's cosine similarity that
  D40 displayed cannot be had from a server-fused response. Three options were
  tabled: fuse client-side in the Worker and keep D40's display; fuse
  server-side and display nothing; fuse server-side and display the RRF score.
  The user chose the second. The third was argued against and not taken: the
  RRF score is a function of rank alone (the top row scores ~0.0328 on
  essentially every query), so displaying it restates the row's position and
  says nothing about match quality — the very reason D40 gave for rejecting it
  originally. **This supersedes D40's display half**: no similarity number on
  the card, and the "Similarity hover" block that D40 locked into
  `site/COPY.md` dies with it (copy edit pending the user's verbatim
  approval). D40's other half — the expanded explanation's clause that the
  explanation also feeds retrieval — remains true (the BM25 leg still searches
  it) and stays. A "matched by both legs" badge was floated as an optional
  replacement signal and is undecided. Engineering facts for the Worker,
  measured live: the fused row cap is root-level `limit` (root-level `top_k` is
  silently ignored); per-leg `top_k` sets each leg's depth before fusion; a
  BM25 leg's `$dist` is a relevance, higher better; at most 16 legs per
  request, snapshot-isolated.
- **D47** (2026-08-20) — **the source pages are rendered by us and hosted by us;
  result cards never link to the public AFP or Isabelle websites.** The user
  rejected external linking outright: the public sites present whatever the
  *current* release holds, our corpus is pinned to Isabelle2025-2 +
  afp-2026-05-13, and after the next AFP release a card's link could show text
  that no longer matches the indexed entity — or 404 on a renamed theory. Hosting
  volume (an estimated 20–40 GB of static HTML) was accepted explicitly.

  **How the pages are produced — no re-proving.** Isabelle's own HTML
  presentation is generated *from the session build databases*, not by running
  proofs; the system manual's own example covers exactly our case: "HTML/PDF
  presentation for sessions that happen to be properly built already, without
  rebuilding anything except the missing browser info: `isabelle build -a -n -o
  browser_info`". The build databases exist on cslh19: the corpus was collected
  from 27 umbrella sessions (`AFP-DEP1-0..21` chained on HOL, then `AFP-ALL-0..4`;
  generators in `tools/Build_AFP_Image/`), built 2026-07-09..13 into the
  distribution's own heap directory, each loading ~384 AFP theories *by
  session-qualified name* — so every theory carries its real long name (e.g.
  `CakeML_Codegen.Sterm`) even though the AFP's own sessions were never built
  individually. `pide_reports` (the option that stores the markup the renderer
  needs) defaults to true and is not overridden on either machine — verified
  2026-08-20 in `etc/options` and both machines' preferences.

  **The URL template — one, not two.** Since we lay out the hosting directory
  ourselves, the AFP/distribution split disappears; session names are globally
  unique, so a single template serves every linkable position:

  > ~~`https://<site>/source/<session>/<Theory>.html#L<line>`~~ — **superseded
  > by D49 (2026-08-21)**: the URL is flat (`/source/<theory long
  > name>.html#L<line>`) and no Worker-side resolution exists any more; each
  > row carries its finished source link. §17 is the authority on the pass.

  ~~The session is resolved Worker-side by matching the position's file basename
  against the row's `theories` array (session-qualified long names)~~ (retired
  by D49 — the review measured this rule's real link coverage at 86.58 %); if
  the row's source link is empty, the card shows D42's absent form. D42's rule — a link iff
  the position starts with `$AFP/` or `~~/`, absolute paths never shown — is
  unchanged; only the link's target moved. `<line>` is the position's own line
  number, and its jump target is an `id="L<line>"` mark that the upload-time
  pass **injects itself, only at the lines some exported record's position
  names** (the user's amendment, 2026-08-21: not every line — the needed-lines
  set is the corpus's distinct (file, line) pairs, which the link-check gate
  computes anyway, so the injector and the gate share one input). A fragment
  that misses leaves the reader at the top of the page — silent, harmless
  degradation to the page-level link.

  **Why injected line marks and not the renderer's own entity anchors** (the
  original 2026-08-20 choice, reversed 2026-08-21 after measurement): the
  renderer emits no line anchors anywhere, and its entity anchors have real
  holes — a locale's bare name has no anchor at all (only `.axioms`/`.intro`/
  `_def` derivatives exist, so all 9,928 locale rows would miss), a
  class-parameter constant is anchored under its class-qualified internal name
  (`…scaleC_class.divideC|const` exists, `…divideC|const` does not), and a
  lemma's suffix depends on the name's shape rather than its kind (`name|fact`
  for a plain name, `name(8)|thm` for an indexed member — both kind `lemma`).
  Quantifying the surviving coverage would have taken a corpus-wide anchor
  census; injected line marks make the census unnecessary, since they cover
  every positioned record — 98.8%, D42's own figure — by construction. What
  makes the injection sound: the rendered `<pre class="source">` block
  reproduces the source line-for-line (measured: HOL.thy 2203 source lines =
  2203 pre-block newlines exactly; BWT.thy 148 vs 147, the difference being
  the trailing-newline convention at EOF only). The kind→anchor-suffix table
  this paragraph used to require is dead.

  **The gate.** Before the rendered tree is uploaded, a link check walks every
  exported document and confirms its target file (and, separately counted, its
  fragment anchor) exists in the tree; a template that 404s is worse than the
  absent form (§16.8's warning). This also retires the multi-session-entry
  hazard measured 2026-08-20: AFP presentation output is keyed by *session*, not
  by entry directory (20 of 974 entries declare secondary sessions —
  `AFP/LEM/Lem_pervasives.html` resolves while `AFP/CakeML/Lem_pervasives.html`
  404s), which is why the session must come from the `theories` array and never
  from the position's first path component.

  **The one-session probe ran 2026-08-20** (user-commanded, on cslh19, after
  backing up the 30 GB system-heaps directory to
  `~/Isabelle2025-2_system_heaps.backup_20260820_201610.tar.zst`, 6.2 GB,
  integrity-checked): `isabelle build -n -o browser_info … AFP-DEP1-0` rendered
  the session **and its ancestors Pure, HOL, HOL-Library in 97 seconds** — the
  2026-08-12 generator edits did *not* make `-n` consider it out of date. What
  the output settled: layout is `browser_info/<chapter>/<session>/`, umbrellas
  land in chapter `Unsorted`; the 412 theory files are named by **qualified long
  name** (`AutoCorres2.ML_Fun_Cache.html`), so the real session is encoded in
  the filename itself — except for dynamically loaded base-logic theories
  (`FOL.html`, `IFOL.html`, `ZF.html` appear unqualified inside `AFP-DEP1-0`),
  so the upload-time restructure into `/source/<session>/` maps through the
  theory-hash registry's long names rather than filename parsing alone; an
  `AFP/` subdirectory holds each theory's auxiliary files (ML sources); entity
  anchors are present in our own output (`id="BWT.bwt_canon_def|fact"`,
  `id="HOL.conjI|fact"`), same scheme as the public sites. The base-logic
  observation also retires a coverage worry: whatever the collection loaded, the
  umbrella databases hold, so the rendered set and the corpus coincide by
  construction.

  **The full render ran 2026-08-20** (user-commanded): all 27 umbrella sessions
  in 24m16s, exit 0 — 11,762 theory pages, 5.1 GB, on cslh19 under
  `~/.isabelle/Isabelle2025-2/browser_info/`. Coverage clears the registry's
  10,594 theories, and the base logics (`FOL.html`, `IFOL.html`, `ZF.html`
  inside `AFP-DEP1-0`) rendered along with everything else the collection
  loaded.

  **Still open under this decision**: the upload-time pass itself (one walk
  that restructures into `/source/<session>/`, rewrites every internal href —
  they are all relative and encode the old layout, measured 2026-08-21 — and
  injects the needed-lines `id="L<line>"` marks), the link-check gate run over
  its output, and where the tree is hosted (decided with §12.2's step 5).
  The pass and the gate are designed in **§17** (2026-08-21, awaiting the
  user's review); implementation follows that review.
- **D46** (2026-08-18) — **the tokenizer asset carries the export machine's whole
  symbol table, component files included.** On this machine that means
  `contrib/phi-system/symbols` and `contrib/phi-system/symbols-words` on top of the
  distribution's own `etc/symbols`: measured 2026-08-19, the distribution file defines
  **439** symbols with a code point and the two phi-System files add **185** more, for
  a loaded table of **624**. Not one of the 185 is used by a published entity, since
  D24 excludes every phi-System entity from the corpus (135 of them are the private-use
  word glyphs of D44, and the other 50 are ordinary symbols). They ship anyway: a visitor who pastes `\<big_ast>` out of a phi-System buffer then gets
  `✱` rather than a condition split into three parts, and the alternative — filtering the
  asset to symbols the corpus uses — makes the asset depend on the corpus as well as on
  the installation, for no gain a visitor can see. What was **not** acceptable was
  leaving this to chance: before this decision the asset's contents depended on which
  components happened to be registered on whichever machine ran the export, which is an
  accident, not a policy. The operational consequence follows from D45 and is stated here
  because it is surprising: **registering or unregistering an unrelated Isabelle component
  changes the asset digest, and therefore the namespace name, even though not one
  published document changes.** An export that finds a different component set than the
  declared one must fail rather than quietly build a differently-named namespace. **The declared
  set is the `ISABELLE_SYMBOLS` file list recorded inside the committed asset from
  the previous export** — §8.2 states the comparison and what the first export does
  instead, since it has nothing to compare against. This decision mandated the
  failure and did not say where the declaration lives; that gap is closed there, not
  here.
- **D45** (2026-08-18, **the namespace half revoked 2026-08-20**) — **the
  tokenizer's data ships as one stamped asset**, ~~and the namespace name carries its
  digest~~. Step 3 needs the symbol table and the
  fold table; §5.2 needs the letter, digit, quasi-letter and ASCII-symbolic sets;
  §5.4 needs the separator class; the condition box needs the abbreviations. All
  of it is emitted once at export time and read by both implementations, which may
  carry none of it themselves (§5.5). The asset also records **where it came
  from** — the `ISABELLE_SYMBOLS` file list, and the Unicode version of the
  character classes — because the file list depends on which components are
  registered, so identical code loads different tables on two machines, and the
  classes depend on the Python release (`isalpha()` is 136,104 code points under
  Unicode 15.0 and node's `\p{L}` is 145,672). Rather than check the asset against
  the index at run time, **the turbopuffer namespace name embeds the asset's
  digest**: a Worker holding an older asset addresses the namespace that asset
  built, so "new index, old asset" is not a state that can be constructed.

  **Amended 2026-08-19: the asset also carries the tokenizer rule's own identity**,
  a `tokenizer_rule` integer bumped by hand whenever §5.1, §5.2 or §5.4 changes what
  the tokenizer does. Without it the digest covers the tokenizer's **data** and not
  its **rules**, and the adversarial review of §5.2's numeric token class showed what
  that costs: that change altered 12,822 expressions and 126,282 names while touching
  the asset's bytes not at all — it reuses the digit set the asset already ships — so
  the digest, and therefore the namespace name, would not have moved. Two of this
  plan's own guarantees fail in that state. §8.2's "write each export into a **new**
  namespace" silently becomes an upsert into the live one, which §8.2 forbids because
  turbopuffer cannot delete what a batch omits. And D46's export guard passes, since
  it compares the file list and the digest and both are unchanged. The state that
  actually bites is not "new index, old asset" but **"new index, old rule"**, and one
  integer in the asset is what makes it as unconstructible as the other. The
  alternative considered and rejected was moving step 3 out of the tokenizer
  altogether — the interface would rewrite `\<Longrightarrow>` while typing, as it
  already rewrites `==>` (§9.3), and the export would normalise the stored text.
  It was rejected because the symbol table is needed either way and that plan only
  moves it to the browser, where the conversion becomes a second implementation
  with no gate over it, whereas inside the tokenizer it is covered by the
  test-vector gate that must exist regardless.

  **Amended again 2026-08-20, and this one takes something away: the namespace name
  does not carry the digest.** The user ruled the name shall be
  `isasearch-<isabelle release>-<afp snapshot>` with a generation number after it
  (§8.2), and said in as many words not to put the asset's SHA-256 in it. The first
  half of this decision stands untouched — the asset is still one stamped file, still
  carries its provenance, still carries `tokenizer_rule`, and D46's guard still
  compares all three. What is given up is the structural half: "new index, old asset"
  and "new index, old rule" were unconstructible **because** the Worker's asset chose
  which namespace it addressed, and with a name the Worker is simply configured with,
  both become possible again, as an ordering mistake between deploying a rule change
  and running its export. The symptom is the one this plan works hardest to avoid —
  no error, just wrong results. It is now an ordering discipline. §8.2 records the
  cheapest way to make it structural again (one extra document carrying the digest,
  and a Worker that refuses to serve on a mismatch), which was offered the same day
  and left for §11's work.
- **D44** (2026-08-17) — **a private-use code point is not substituted.** Step 3
  leaves such a symbol as its literal `\<name>`. A private-use code point means
  only what the font declaring it draws — phi-System draws 135 keywords that way
  from U+E000 to U+E086, and no other symbol in the distribution or in that
  component uses the range — so substituting it would put a character in the index
  that renders as a blank box outside jEdit and that no visitor can type, while
  the escape at least spells the word. `Isabelle_RPC_Host.pretty_unicode`
  implements this; its reverse direction still names a raw private-use character,
  because text dragged out of jEdit carries one and naming it is a repair. Both
  directions settle: `ascii_of_unicode` then `pretty_unicode` is a fixed point.
- **D43** (2026-08-18) — **the tokenizer is defined over characters, not Isabelle
  symbols.** The `symbol_explode` step is dropped, and with it the claim that a
  `\<foo>` "can never be cut in half" — false of the subtoken level, the only one
  indexed, since §5.4 splits at `_` regardless of symbol boundaries. Measured, and re-measured
  independently on 2026-08-19 with the same result: the change moves 0.23 % of
  subtoken arrays (3,135 of 1,362,096 expressions), all of them escapes left literal
  by step 3. **3,118 of the 3,135 are pure refinements** — `\<^named_theorems>` stops
  indexing as the unsearchable `['\<^named','theorems>']` — and the remaining **17
  lose one subtoken of bare punctuation**, of which **three are AFP entries that D24
  exports**: see §5.1 for the pattern and the three names.
  Two review findings dissolve with the step: that §5.1's justification was false,
  and that the treatment of a malformed or unterminated `\<` was unspecified —
  `\<=` is now simply one symbolic run. §5.3's eleven equivalences and §16.2's
  thirty-two cases were re-run under the new definition and all still hold, and were
  re-run again on 2026-08-19 with zero mismatches, so no line of either table is
  stale. **The prototype in `site/prototype/` still implements the old, pre-D43
  rule**, and the difference between the two is exactly these 3,135 records and
  nothing else — see §16.1 for what that means for anything the prototype measured.
- **D42** (2026-08-14) — **every result card carries a source link**, not just
  the entity page (§9.4). It resolves through the entity position, whose coverage
  is **98.8 %** as of 2026-08-20 — the 80.2 % this decision was taken under was a
  `cslh19`-only figure from before the backfill finished and the snapshot was
  republished. So roughly one card in eighty has no link, not one in five. **The
  defined absent form is still required**, and the decision does not change: the link
  is not to be rendered dead or blank without a word. Prerequisite C has landed
  (§12.2), so it is visible now.

  **Only two kinds of position become a link, and the rest are the absent form.**
  `ENTITY_POSITION_PLAN.md`'s L1' stores a position under `$AFP` or `~~` — the two
  roots whose contents are identical on every machine — as that symbolic path, and
  **every other position as an absolute path**. So the rule is:

  > A position is rendered as a link **iff** its path begins with `$AFP/` or `~~/`.
  > Any other position — an absolute path, an empty one, or one this site cannot
  > parse — renders the same absent form as no position at all. An absolute path is
  > never shown to a visitor, in the link or anywhere else.

  The second half is not tidiness. D24 accepts that its session-name test may leak
  ("a statement written in a local file whose constants all come from published
  sessions still ships"), and such a record's position is an absolute path on the
  export machine — `/home/…`. Rendering it publishes a private filesystem layout on
  a public page, and a rule that only says "resolve the position" produces exactly
  that. This clause is the author's implementation of D42, not a further decision of
  the user's; what it must never do is widen. The two URL templates — the AFP browser
  for `$AFP/`, the Isabelle library browser for `~~/` — are settled at implementation
  time against the live sites and belong in §16.8's list, because a template that
  404s is worse than the absent form.
- **D41** (2026-08-14, extended by D45) — **the tokenizer's character classes ship as data, and
  the test vectors must contain synthetic input.** §5.2 defined its classes by
  naming Python's `isalpha`, `isdigit`, `isnumeric` and `isspace`, which have no
  JavaScript equivalent, so §5.5's required port could not be written from this
  document without hard-coding exactly what §5.5 forbids. Measured divergences
  that follow from the obvious substitutes: `²` (U+00B2 — this said "640
  occurrences in the corpus", which is the count over §3.3's 230,944-document test
  namespace; over the whole corpus it is **3,955**) satisfies `isdigit()` but is
  category `No`, so `\p{Nd}` disagrees; **`\p{L}` is not `isalpha()` either** —
  136,104 code points against node's 145,672, a 9,568 gap that is pure Unicode
  version drift (15.0 against 17.0) and exists across Python releases too, which is
  why D45's asset records the version it was built under;
  U+001C-U+001F and U+0085 satisfy `isspace()` but lie outside `\s`; U+FEFF is
  the reverse. So the export emits the letter, digit, quasi-letter, separator and
  ASCII-symbolic code-point sets into **the asset** alongside the symbol table, and
  neither implementation may consult a language built-in. (D45 later fixed that this
  is **one file**, and this document says "the asset", singular, everywhere: the
  digest that names the turbopuffer namespace is the digest of one file, so a plural
  would leave it undefined which one is meant.) Separately, §16.5's real inputs are all sampled from
  entity expressions and names, on which pipeline steps 1
  and 3 are provably the identity (§3.4: the store is 100 % NFC and
  `unicode_of_ascii` is identity on it) — so a port that omits NFC normalisation
  and ASCII-escape conversion passes the gate byte for byte and then returns
  nothing for `\<Longrightarrow>`, one of the two input routes §9.3 promises.
  The file must therefore also carry synthetic cases: ASCII-escaped input, NFD
  input, unfoldable subscripts, separator-only conditions, and the `²` / U+FEFF
  boundary characters. Its encoding, ordering, count and digest are pinned so
  that "both implementations passed" is itself checkable.
- **D40** (2026-08-14) — **the result card shows a cosine similarity, and says
  whose.** Hover copy: *"Cosine similarity between your query and this entity,
  computed with Qwen3-Embedding-8B. The result order also accounts for keyword
  matching, so a lower score can appear higher up."* Naming the model settles an
  open point: the number displayed is the **vector leg's cosine similarity**,
  not the RRF fusion score, which is a function of rank (`1/(k+rank)` summed)
  and means nothing to a reader. The consequence is that the displayed numbers
  are not monotone down the page, since D36 orders by the fused score — hence
  the third sentence. The expanded explanation's disclaimer gains one clause,
  that the explanation also feeds retrieval, so a poor one can cost an entity
  its place in the results. No "AI" label on the collapsed row: twenty of them
  on a page is noise.
- **D39** (2026-08-14) — **`name_subtokens` indexes the long name only**, and
  the interface speaks in long names. Measured: subtoken splitting decomposes
  `Path_Connected.path_image_join` into
  `['Path','Connected','path','image','join']`, so the short name is an adjacent
  run inside it and `path_image_join`, `image_join` and the full long name all
  match. Indexing both forms was considered and is unnecessary. Accepted
  consequence: a condition like `List` in `Entity Name` matches everything whose
  long name begins with that theory, so `Entity Name` and `Theory Name` overlap.

  **Example corrected, 2026-08-14.** This decision was first written with
  `HOL-Analysis.Path_Connected.path_image_join` as the worked example, which is
  not a name that exists. An Isabelle fact's long name is qualified by the
  **theory base name**, not by the session — that is simply how Isabelle names
  facts — and the store agrees: no entity name in the 1,362,343 records of this
  machine carries a session prefix (the claim is about how Isabelle names facts, so
  the authority cannot differ). (The 1,266 names with a hyphen in their first segment are
  theories whose own base name contains one, such as `Nominal-HOLCF.Def_eqvt` and
  `HOLCF-Utils.fun_upd_cont`.) The export therefore indexes the stored name
  unchanged and adds nothing. Nothing else in D39 changes.

  Worth noting for the interface, since the two fields differ: `theory_subtokens`
  **is** session-qualified — 8,329 distinct theory long names, of which only
  `Pure`, `FOL`, `IFOL` and `ZF` carry no session. So the same theory is written
  `Path_Connected` inside an entity name and `HOL-Analysis.Path_Connected` in the
  theory field, and `site/COPY.md` §3.1 tells the visitor so.
- **D38** (2026-08-14) — **selected Kind chips are OR-ed**: ticking several
  means "any of these kinds". Text conditions are AND-ed (§6.3), so the two
  controls combine differently and the interface has to say so. Under the
  reversed D5 each record carries exactly one `kind`, so the chips are a
  straightforward membership test; `Introduction rule` and `Theorem` are
  disjoint record kinds rather than one containing the other, which is a
  labelling matter for a tooltip and not a functional one — under D29's
  default (nothing selected, restricting nothing, as amended 2026-08-24)
  most users never meet it. ~~The export additionally
  stores, on every record, the full set of kinds its `(name, entity expression)`
  group appears under, so a card's kind badges are complete and do not vary with
  which group members reached the result set; it is aggregated during the §8.1
  grouping step at effectively no cost.~~ **Withdrawn by the user, 2026-08-25.**
  The clause was never implemented on either side — §6.1's schema never listed
  such a field — and the Worker's adversarial review found the code silently
  implementing the alternative. Ruled: a card's kind badges are the kinds of
  the group members that reached the result set, so they can differ between
  two searches for the same entity; the user judged this unimportant. The
  `Introduction rule` button's hover, which promised both labels on one card,
  is deleted with it (COPY §3.6).
- **D37** (2026-08-14) — **variable names stay in the index; the noise is
  accepted.** D4 discards `?`, which demotes a schematic variable to an ordinary
  name, so `P`, `Q`, `x`, `f` are indexed exactly like constant names. The cost
  is measured and real: over §3.3's 230,944-document test namespace, `x` is a
  subtoken of 22.95 % of documents, `a` 17.50 %, `P` 10.80 % and `f` 10.49 %. That
  denominator was not stated here before, and it matters: over the whole corpus the
  same quantities move — `P` up to about 12.8 % and `a` down to about 16.6 % — so a
  user filtering on `f` matches roughly a tenth of the corpus either way, nearly all
  of it accidental, which is the point and is robust to which population is counted. Excluding variable positions was
  considered and not taken — the records store printed text, not term structure,
  and a free variable is indistinguishable from a constant in that text, so
  excluding them would mean changing what the collection side records, not the
  export. Reinstating `?` was also rejected: it would reverse D4, whose reason
  (users do not type the question mark) still holds, and it would not help with
  free variables anyway. **Consequence, discharged 2026-08-14:** §13b's empty-state page was premised on
  `?P ⟹ ?Q` matching nothing, which is false — it matches 60 records. The page was
  rebuilt on `?n + ?m = ?m + ?n`, measured 0, paired with `?a + ?b = ?b + ?a`,
  measured 15, so that the reason for the miss is visible. `site/COPY.md` §5.1 carries
  the result and is authoritative; nothing is outstanding here.
- **D36** (2026-08-14, **superseded 2026-08-25**) — retrieval was hybrid: one
  `multi_query` with a vector leg and a BM25 leg over `interpretation`, RRF-fused
  by turbopuffer with constant 60, the filter tree on both legs (§6.6).
  **The BM25 leg and the fusion are removed.** The user tried the hybrid results
  on the built site and judged them clearly worse than semantic similarity alone,
  so every search is now the vector leg alone, 200 rows, filter tree attached.
  The BM25 checkbox that let a visitor choose (D36 as amended 2026-08-24) is
  deleted from the interface with it, and the request body no longer accepts a
  `bm25` field. What survives of D36 is the correctness requirement it was
  written for: the filter tree rides the leg, so nothing bypasses a syntactic
  condition.
- **D35** (2026-08-14) — **rate limiting is two built layers plus one
  specified-but-unbuilt**, detailed in §11.1: a free Cloudflare edge rule at 5
  requests per IP per 10 seconds, a Workers KV counter at 1,000 per IP per UTC
  day, and a Durable Object global token bucket at 10,000/hour that is **not**
  built yet. Every trip returns 429; there is no BM25 degradation path. The
  Cloudflare zone stays on the Free plan and the only recurring cost is Workers
  Paid at $5/month. Layer 1 is load-bearing for layer 2, not redundant with it
  (KV allows one write per second per key).
- **D34** (2026-08-13) — **the `f⇩C` / `f C` subtoken collision is accepted, not
  fixed.** A subscripted identifier whose subscript character has no fold entry
  tokenizes to `['f','⇩','C']` and therefore yields the subtokens `['f','C']`,
  identical to the function application `f C`; where a fold entry does exist the
  opposite happens and `f⇩i` collapses to `['f']`, losing the subscript. Both
  measured. The consequence is real — an `excludes f C` condition silently drops
  documents mentioning the constant `f⇩C` — and the user has judged it
  acceptable rather than narrow D21's rule again. **Do not re-raise this**; it is
  a known, deliberate limitation of the single-mechanism design.
- **D33** (2026-08-13) — **`BUG_UNIVERSAL_KEY_SHORT_NAME_FIX_PLAN.md` is a
  prerequisite of everything in phase one that touches the store**, which is §12.2's
  steps 4 and 5. It is **not** a prerequisite of step 3, the tokenizer freeze, which
  touches no keys: §12.2 says so and this decision used to say "the whole of phase
  one", which contradicted it. Its defect — a process-global
  first-writer-wins memo on theory short names — leaves 234,398 records holding
  keys the current process cannot reproduce and mis-targets anything that
  selects records by theory, which is precisely what the theory filter does
  (D14, D23), and it passes the XOR self-check silently. Its repair rebuilds the
  store under corrected keys, so any export run before it would publish wrong
  theory data under document ids that the rebuild then changes — taking every
  permanent entity-page URL D25 ships with it. §7.2's "already in the DB, 100 %"
  cell was wrong until that plan ran; it is now correct.

  **Done, 2026-08-18.** The store on `cslh19` has been migrated: a persistent theory's
  hash is now `clear_lsb(xxh128(long_name ++ 0x00 ++ file bytes ++ parent hashes))`, with
  parents contributing their own new hashes so the long name — which is session-qualified
  — propagates down the ancestor DAG. Verified on the authoritative store, read-only:
  `fsck` passes every invariant over 1,343,793 records, **including "XOR key prefix
  disagrees with constituents: 0"**, which is the self-check the original defect used to
  pass silently and which only became meaningful once two theories sharing a base name
  stopped sharing an identity. `orphans` reports **84 records (0.006 %)** owned by a
  theory hash no local name claims, against the defect's original signature of 234,398.
  Not re-verified: G1 of `THEORY_HASH_REKEY_PLAN.md` — that every stored hash is
  reproducible from the `.thy` file by today's algorithm — because it needs the
  dependency table dumped from an Isabelle image, and that file is no longer on disk.
  **To regenerate it**: on `cslh19`, feed the SML snippet of `THEORY_HASH_REKEY_PLAN.md`
  §9.1 to `isabelle console -l AFP-ALL-4 -n` on stdin (`-n` suppresses any build; the
  image takes about four minutes to load), strip the `Poly/ML>` prompts, and keep the
  `DEP`-prefixed rows as `deps.tsv` — 10,598 of them, `Pure` included by the parent
  closure. Then build the tables per §9.2 of that plan and run G1. It is a read-only
  check and needs no rebuild.
- **D32** (2026-08-13) — **D20 is lifted, and the work is staged: the whole
  data side first, the web application after.** The phase boundary is §12.2's
  step 5/6 line. Phase one is the tokenizer module, the site export, the
  production namespace, and the Worker's search API with its rate limiting —
  everything that can be verified without a page to look at. Phase two is the
  interface of §9, whose design is now settled to D22/D26/D29/D30 and whose
  mockup exists at `site/design/IsaSearch.dc.html`. Nothing in phase two starts
  before phase one's export has produced a namespace that answers queries
  correctly.
- **D31** (2026-08-13) — **the published vector is f16, 4096 dimensions.**
  Not a reduction in dimension: only in dtype. turbopuffer counts f16 at 2
  bytes per dimension for storage and queries, halving the namespace from
  ~23 GB to ~11.5 GB and the per-query charge from $0.000023 to $0.0000115 on
  1,362,343 documents (§11.1b — these read ~21 GB and $0.000021 while that
  subsection was still computed on the merged count D5's reversal replaced). Dimension reduction, which would have cut a further 5×, is **not**
  taken — it discards information, its recall cost is unmeasured, and D3 leaves
  no reranker to absorb the loss. f16 is the option that costs nothing to
  reason about: the local store already holds Q1.15 int16, and for the
  component magnitudes of a unit-norm 4096-dimension vector (~0.016) f16's
  exponent makes it *finer* than Q1.15, not coarser. **That last point is
  analysis, not measurement** — converting the real stored vectors and
  measuring the ranking change would settle it, and should be done before the
  export publishes. Note writes are unaffected: turbopuffer bills f16 at 4
  bytes per dimension for writes because it does not linearly reduce indexing
  cost, so the one-off load still costs ~$42, or ~$21 batched. This settles Q14.
- **D30** (2026-08-13) — **the site is `isasearch`, its interface is English,
  and the machine-generated disclosure is the sentence the design already
  carries**: "Written by a language model from the formal statement, not by the
  theory's authors. It may be imprecise or wrong; the statement above is
  authoritative." All three come from `site/design/IsaSearch.dc.html` rather
  than being invented here. This settles Q7.

  **Amended by the user on 2026-08-14 — the second sentence changes.** The
  disclosure now reads: *"Written by a language model from the formal statement,
  not by the theory's authors. It may be imprecise or wrong. Where the
  explanation and the statement disagree, the statement is the correct one."*
  (D40's third sentence follows it; see `site/COPY.md` §4.2, "The expanded
  explanation", for the whole string.) Reason: two consecutive rounds of reader testing named
  **`authoritative`** the worst word on the site. Its everyday sense is *sounds
  expert*, so the original sentence can be read as praise for the explanation
  rather than as ranking the formal statement above it — the reverse of its
  purpose, in the single sentence that guards against trusting machine-written
  prose about a formal statement. The first sentence and the site name are
  unchanged, and the amendment does not reopen anything else in D30.
- **D29** (2026-08-13) — three of Q11's choices, settled:
  - **Hybrid retrieval is on by default, fused with RRF** (reciprocal rank
    fusion). No weight to tune, and it covers the exact-name intent a
    bi-encoder handles poorly (§6.5). Whether turbopuffer bills a `multi_query`
    once or once per sub-query is unmeasured and is **not** a design input —
    even at double it is ~$2/day at 100,000 searches.
  - **The kind filter defaults to everything selected.** Defaulting to theorems
    only would leave someone hunting a constant with no results and no visible
    reason, which is this site's worst failure mode; theorems are 84.9 % of the
    corpus and dominate the ranking anyway.

    **Amended 2026-08-24 (user-ruled): the default is nothing selected, and
    an empty selection means no kind constraint.** Behaviourally identical to
    everything-selected — the failure mode above still cannot occur — but the
    common intent "only this kind" now costs one click instead of ten
    deselections. Theorems-only as a default was proposed and rejected in the
    same exchange (it silently excludes the very entity a non-theorem hunt is
    for). The interface explains nothing about the empty state (user-ruled:
    readers do not expect an empty filter to return nothing); the old
    cleared-every-kind blocking state and its message are deleted with this —
    that state no longer exists. D38's OR reading applies to a non-empty
    selection; an empty selection sends no kind condition at all.

    **Amended again 2026-08-25 (user-ruled): the kind selection filters and
    nothing else.** It used to enter the embedding instruction, and so changed
    the ranking as well as the eligible set; §6.3b records the removal and why.
  - **A search fetches 200 results in one request** and pages in the browser at
    20 a screen; turning a page issues no new request. **200 is the end of the
    result list — there is no "load more" and no second request.** This follows
    from turbopuffer charging the whole
    namespace per *request*: 200 results in one request costs $0.000031, the
    same 200 fetched twenty at a time costs $0.00021 — **minimise requests, not
    results**, which is the opposite of the usual instinct. Against a
    full-length query the returned-data term is 4 % of a search, so the real
    ceiling is response payload: 200 results is ~200 KB, fine; 1,000 would be
    ~1 MB paid on every search including the ones answered by result three.
    Nobody reads to result 200 of a ranked semantic search, and D7 guarantees
    there is always a ranking, so a bounded list is honest rather than limiting.
  - **A dataset download link is offered.** It points at the existing Hugging
    Face dataset and conda channel — the database is already published there,
    so this is a link and not a second copy to maintain. The user's answer to
    whether to offer it was one word, "放". The trade-off an earlier draft
    attributed to him — that he weighed it against letting someone build a
    competing site and chose the citation — is the author's reasoning, not his,
    and is recorded that way so that reopening this needs only his word and not
    new evidence about competitors.
  - **The five test namespaces stay** (§3.6, ~168 MB, ~$0.06/month, absorbed by
    the $16 floor). The user left the call to the author; three of them are the
    evidence D21 and D22 rest on and will be wanted for regression once the
    export is real. Revisit after the first production namespace is verified.
  - **The query is capped at 8,000 characters, and each filter condition at
    512 characters** (revised 2026-08-14; originally "2,048 tokens"). Two
    reasons. **`token` already means something else here** — §1's glossary fixes
    it as an output element of the tokenizer, while the cap meant the embedding
    model's BPE tokens, so one word carried two meanings in one document. And
    **a Worker cannot count BPE tokens**: that needs the model's ~151,000-entry
    vocabulary shipped to the edge, so the one component on the query path could
    not enforce the cap in the unit it was written in. Characters are exact and
    free to count there. The per-condition cap is new — draft 3 bounded the
    natural-language query and bounded a filter condition nowhere, though the
    Worker runs the tokenizer over those too. With no spend cap (D28) these
    bounds exist to stay inside Fireworks' own input limit, to stop an unbounded
    request body being an attack surface, and to bound the tokenizer's work;
    they are not a cost control. 8,000 characters is roughly what 2,048 tokens
    meant. The original argument against a character cap — `⟹` is one character
    and its ASCII escape eighteen, so a character cap is harsher on users who
    cannot type Unicode mathematics — still stands, and is why the limit is
    generous rather than tight.
- **D28** (2026-08-13, **cancelled the same day**) — there is **no daily spend
  cap**. A $5/day figure was floated and then withdrawn: the user's instruction
  is that cost is not a design constraint and no functionality is to be traded
  for it. Nothing in this plan may be justified by, or cut because of, the
  running bill. §11.1b's measurements stay — they are useful for capacity
  planning and for noticing a runaway — but they are **not** a budget, and no
  component enforces one. Rate limiting survives on its own footing (§11.1): an
  anonymous public endpoint that spends someone's API credit needs a bound
  against hammering and runaway clients, which is an operational concern, not an
  accounting one.

- **D27** (2026-08-13) — **no cache warming.** `hint_cache_warm` is not to be
  used. It is free only when the namespace is already warm — that is, only when
  the search it precedes would have been fast anyway — and when the namespace is
  cold it "is billed as a query that returns zero rows", which at the shipped
  f16 namespace of ~11.5 GB costs $0.0000115, exactly what a real search's queried
  term costs (§11.1b). It therefore charges full price
  precisely when it would help, and a visitor who loads a page and searches once
  pays twice. Accepted cost: the first query after an idle period pays cold
  latency, which turbopuffer's own figures put at ~300 ms, p90 1,214 ms on large
  datasets.
- **D26** (2026-08-13) — **a theorem's result card shows no theory line.** That
  much is the user's, and he reached it himself: "我认为对于 theorem-like 是不显示
  theory consitutent 比较好。你觉得呢？" It stands, and the exception that once
  qualified it is gone.

  **The exception, removed 2026-08-26 by D55.** It was the author's and was
  never put to the user: when a Theory Name condition was active, the card
  marked which of the theorem's constituent theories had matched — the one case
  in which a theorem card printed a constituent theory at all. It existed
  because a theorem carried seven of them on average and a reader could not
  otherwise tell which the condition had found. A record carries one theory
  now, so a condition that matches has matched it. Name-addressed entities also
  no longer print their declaring theory on the card: since 2026-08-25 the
  source line under the name carries it with the file and the line, and the
  entity page says it in a sentence (COPY §8's `Defined in`).

  The measurement below is why the author
  agrees with the default, not how the default was decided: only 0.2 % of
  theorem-alike records have fewer than three constituent theories, so
  truncation is the norm; and the alphabetically first constituent belongs to
  session `HOL` in **40.8 %** of records and to some `HOL-*` session in ~12 %
  more, so an alphabetical rule shows a base logic most of the time. The rule
  that does work — show the constituent whose base name matches the entity
  name's first segment, 85.3 % unique per §3.2 — shows a word the user has
  already read in the name directly above. So the line is either redundant or
  uninformative, with no third case. The complete list stays on the entity page
  (§9.4). This settles Q8.
- **D25** (2026-08-12) — **entity pages ship in the first release** (D9, §9.4),
  and every result card links to one. The delivered design already does this:
  the entity name on each card is an anchor, as is the related-entities list on
  the entity page itself. This settles Q9.
- **D24** (2026-08-12, rule revised 2026-08-13) — **only entities that live
  entirely inside AFP and the Isabelle distribution are exported.** The original
  wording gated on the *declaring theory* being in the `AFP-ALL-4` chain, which
  is inexpressible for the 84.9 % of records that are content-addressed and have
  no declaring theory (D13). The rule that works, and that covers both
  addressing schemes with one test:

  > An entity is exported iff every theory it names has a session prefix in the
  > set of sessions declared by the `ROOT` files of `contrib/afp-2026-05-13` and
  > `contrib/Isabelle2025-2` (1,146 sessions), treating the four prefix-less base
  > logics `Pure`, `FOL`, `IFOL` and `ZF` as members (§7.2).

  **The count was 1,150 here until 2026-08-20, and the reader that produced it was
  wrong twice over.** It matched `session` lines with a pattern that stopped at the
  first `+`, so `session "CoreC++"` — a real AFP entry — declared nothing and its
  2,915 records read as out of scope; and it did not strip `(* … *)`, so six
  commented-out sessions read as declared. Both are fixed in
  `src/site_export.py` (this repository, since the 2026-08-24 migration —
  §12.1), and the corrected reader admits every
  session any record in the store names. The two readers were run against each other
  over the whole corpus and the six comment cases change **no** record's verdict; the
  `CoreC++` one changes 2,915.

  For a theorem-alike entity "the theories it names" is `theory_constituents`;
  for a name-addressed one it is its declaring theory. No `AFP-ALL-4` chain
  resolution and no entity position is needed.

  **The scope the user set is `AFP-ALL-4` and nothing else** — his words, on
  2026-08-19: "我的意思就是只针对 AFP-ALL-4，目前别考虑别的，之后可能会加上别的数据，
  但目前不会。" So the session test above is an *implementation* of that scope, not a
  widening of it, and adding a source later is a decision the user takes, not a rule
  an implementer relaxes. The test replaced chain resolution because the chain is
  inexpressible for the 84.9 % of records that have no declaring theory, and the two
  were **measured to agree**: on `cslh19`, 2026-08-19, over the 1,144,749 records
  carrying `theory_constituents`, exactly **one** names a session that the ROOT files
  declare and the `AFP-ALL-4` image does not hold, and over the 199,044 name-addressed
  records — every one of whose declaring theories the theory-hash registry resolved —
  **none** does. That single record is `HOL.Trueprop_code`, whose constituents are
  `HOL.HOL`, `Pure` and `Tools.Code_Generator`; the image plainly holds all three, and
  the divergence is a gap in the theory list the comparison used
  (`tools/Build_AFP_Image/afp_all4_roots.heap.txt` carries no `Pure`-level session at
  all), not a record outside the scope. Over the present corpus the two rules select
  the same 1,343,793 records.

  Measured 2026-08-13 over 1,156,333 records — which is the 1,156,153 theorem-alike
  records of §3.1 **plus the 180 `EXPERIENCE` records**, since the scan took every
  record carrying `theory_constituents`; the 180 are excluded from the export
  separately by step 0 of §8.1, so they cannot change the outcome, only the
  denominator by 0.016 %. Of those: **30,304 (2.62 %)**
  fall outside, of which 12,421 are the `IFOL` false positive the base-logic
  clause above fixes, leaving **17,883 (1.55 %)** genuinely outside. They are two
  families: the why3/NTP4VC generated material (`pearl_*`, `Why3STD`,
  `NTP4Verif`, `frama_c_*`, ~7,700) and **phi-system** (`Phi_BI`, `Phi_System`,
  `Phi_Logic_Programming_Reasoner`, `Phi_Semantics_Framework`, ~10,173). **Both
  are excluded**; the user decided on 2026-08-13 that phi-system does not go in
  the public index, so no session is whitelisted.

  The user has also accepted that this rule may leak: it is a session-name test,
  not a provenance test, so a statement written in a local file whose constants
  all come from published sessions still ships. Do not add machinery to close
  that — it was weighed and accepted.

- **D23** (2026-08-12) — **every filterable array is a subtoken array.** The
  theory filter switches from whole tokens to subtokens, so `theory_tokens`
  becomes `theory_subtokens` and D21's rule governs all three. D22 forces this:
  the `All` panel `Or`s one typed string across all three fields, and if one of
  them tokenised differently the same string would mean different things inside
  a single condition — `Sorted` matching in two fields and silently failing in
  the third, inside a control that promises "any of the three". Independently it
  fixes the same defect D6/§5.4 exist to fix, left standing in a second field:
  a user who types `Sorted` did not match `HOL-Library.Sorted_Sort`. §3.6's `Or`
  experiment already used a `theory_subtokens` field, so its measured figures
  assume this.
- **D22** (2026-08-12) — **five filter panels, in this order and with these
  labels**: `Entity Name`, `Expression`, `Theory Name`, `All`, `Kind`.
  *(Amended 2026-08-24, user-ruled in the design pass: the panel group's
  visible heading is `Filters`, no longer `Syntactic filters`. The five
  panel labels are unchanged.)* Each of
  the first three is a repeatable list of single-line conditions, every
  condition carrying its own `contains`/`excludes` toggle (the control model the
  delivered design uses — §9.1). `All` matches a condition against any of the
  other three and compiles to an `Or` (§6.3), verified available and affordable
  (§3.6); hovering it reveals which three fields it covers. `Kind` stays a
  multi-select chip group. This closes Q12: `name_subtokens` now has an
  interface control and stays in the export.
  *The user rejected `Anywhere` as a label — too vague — and rejected placing
  the combined panel first; `All` sits after the three specific panels.* The
  author argued for a bare `Theory` label on the ground that a theorem carries
  a mean of 7.1 associated theories (§7.2) and `Theory Name` reads singular;
  the user judged `Theory Name` clearly clearer and took `Entity Name` as its
  parallel. Recorded as decided. The plural sense is carried by D15's
  explanatory sentence beside the field (§9.2b), not by the label.
- **D21** (2026-08-12) — **one matching mechanism, not two.** An expression
  condition is matched as `["expr_subtokens", "ContainsTokenSequence", …]` and
  nothing else. The `expr_tokens` field and the `ContainsAllTokens` operator are
  both dropped. To make that survivable, §5.4's subtoken rule is narrowed: it
  discards only the separators it splits on (`_`, `.`, and sub/superscript
  characters) and **keeps every operator token**, where the old rule discarded
  every fragment with no alphanumeric character and so erased `⟹`, `::`, `=`,
  `⟦`, `⟧` from the filterable index entirely. See §5.4 for the rule, §6.3 for
  what a condition compiles to, and §14.6 for the two alternatives rejected —
  including the literal form of this decision the user first proposed
  (`ContainsAllTokens` as the single operator), which was rejected on measured
  grounds.
- **D55** (2026-08-26) — **a Theory Name condition matches one theory, the one
  the entity is written in, for every kind alike; and that theory is derived
  once in the export and stored, never recomputed in a browser.**

  This **supersedes D14** and, with it, the interface obligation **D15** placed
  on the difference D14 created, and **D26**'s card marking. D14 gave the
  Theory Name field two meanings — a name-addressed entity's declaring theory,
  a theorem-alike entity's constituent theories — because Isabelle records no
  declaring theory for a theorem (D13, which stands: nothing here invents one).
  Two consequences followed. The interface had to explain the split (four
  drafts, §13b), and the filter barely filtered: 99 % of statements mention
  something from `HOL`, so `HOL.` matched 98.6 % of theorem-alike records.

  What D13 leaves out is not the only evidence available. A theorem's **source
  position** is recorded for 98.8 % of the corpus, and §17's map already
  resolves a position file to exactly one published theory page named by the
  theory. So the theory is **derived from evidence, not invented**. The rule,
  in order: Isabelle's own declaring theory for a name-addressed entity (the
  key's 16-byte prefix — its position is *not* consulted, and must not be:
  1,236 records are declared in one theory and positioned in another file);
  otherwise the theory the position's page names; otherwise the theory base
  name the record's own name begins with — of `from_collection` for a
  collection member, whose position points at the collector rather than at the
  fact — resolved against the record's own dependencies first and the published
  tree second, ambiguity resolving to nothing rather than to a guess.

  Measured over the whole store, 2026-08-26: position resolves **98.40 %** of
  theorem-alike records, the fallback carries it to **99.95 %**, name-addressed
  is **100 %**, and **533** (0.04 %) resolve to nothing and therefore match no
  Theory Name condition at all. Cross-checked twice: against each record's own
  name (**99.88 %** agree) and against the 198,483 name-addressed records whose
  answer is already known from the key hash (**99.38 %** agree) — every
  disagreement in both being `AutoCorres2.CLocals`, whose ML machinery mints
  entities for eleven theories from inside its own file (§17's opening already
  names it). Filtering `HOL.` now selects **4.0 %** instead of 98.6 %, and
  **9,796** theories are reachable by a condition instead of 8,329.

  **Where the derivation lives is part of the ruling** (the user's, in his own
  words: the information should be computed locally and stored, so that a
  better way of computing it later costs one re-export and no front-end
  change). It is computed beside `source_links` in `site_source_pages.py`, off
  the same `(file, page)` pair, so a row cannot carry a link into one theory
  and name another.

  The column layout this implies, and the three deletions that fall out, are
  §6.1's; the interface consequences are COPY §3.4 (the caveat, deleted) and
  §8 (the section renamed and narrowed to theorems, and a `Defined in` line
  added to the Source block). **D24's scope test keeps using the dependency
  set**, not this one theory: the scope question is whether everything a record
  needs comes from a declared session, which one theory cannot answer.

## 3. Measured evidence

Everything in this section was measured, not assumed. A reviewer should treat any
claim elsewhere in this document that is *not* here as an assumption. The first pass
was taken on 2026-08-09; §3.1's counts, §3.2's prefix arithmetic and §3.4's character
figures were re-measured on **2026-08-19** and each says so where it differs from the
original reading.

**Which machine a figure came from mattered until 2026-08-19, and the rule for
reading the older ones is below.** `cslh19` is the authority (D19, and the user's
ruling of 2026-08-18: "一切以 cslh19 的数据为准").

**As of 2026-08-19 this machine holds the authority's store, verified whole.** The
user synced it here, and the two were compared field by field rather than assumed
equal: 1,343,793 entity keys on each side with **zero** in either difference; the
`(kind, name)` pair identical for every one of them; and a digest over every record's
`expr` and `interpretation`, ordered by key, identical on both machines —

```
whole-store digest, cslh19 and this machine, 2026-08-19
a2dbbb874fe178867dd07bc05901fc96      1,343,793 records
```

Recompute that digest to find out whether any machine's store is this state; it is
the cheapest available answer, and it is what `scratchpad/audit/exprdump.py` prints.

**Figures on this machine dated before 2026-08-19 are from a different generation of
the database and are void as counts.** D33's re-key changed every universal key, so
the store that stood here until the sync shared **not one key** with the authority.
By content it held 36,710 entities the authority does not — phi-System (`Phi_Types`,
`Phi_BI`, `Phi_Semantics_Framework`, `PLPR`, all excluded by D24), local example
theories, and the 880 `Approximation` records the user ordered abandoned during the
D33 migration — and lacked 11,818 the authority has, mostly `EXPERIENCE` records,
which are never published. A **ratio over expression text** taken then survives
better than a count, since a re-key changes keys and not `expr` and the populations
differ by about 1.4 %, but anything load-bearing should be re-measured now that the
authority's corpus is available locally. Every figure below says where it came from;
one that does not is a defect.

**What was re-measured on the authority on 2026-08-19, and what was deliberately
left.** The user left the scope of the sweep to the author, so here is the line it
drew. Re-measured, because a rule of §5 rests on each of them and each came free in
§16.3 step 1's pass: the corpus counts of §3.1; the tokenizer comparison of §16.3
step 1 in full; pipeline step 3's effect on stored text (§5.1); §5.4's fallback-clause
quantity; §5.2's astral-character share, its rejected unqualified numeric rule, and
its `isdigit()`-against-`isnumeric()` agreement; §16.5's digit-abutting frequency; §6.1's two claims about the shipped arrays, that
none is empty and what their mean length is; and
`corpus_probe.py`'s two worked match counts (§16.1). Every one of them is now stated
against the authority's corpus beside the figure it replaces.

Left alone, on purpose: **§11.1b's storage and cost arithmetic**, because it is
computed from the record count and nothing else, and the count fell by 1.36 % — so
every figure there is high by about that much, which is the safe direction for a
budget and does not change a single decision. And **the figures §5.4 and §3.6 take
over §3.3's 230,944-document namespace**, because that namespace is itself a
historical construction rather than a subset of the authority's store; §5.4 already
labels every one of them with that denominator, so they are dated rather than wrong.
Anything else in this document that gives a count without saying which corpus it came
from is, by the paragraph above, a defect.

### 3.1 The corpus

**Re-measured on `cslh19`, 2026-08-19.** The user ruled on 2026-08-18 that
`cslh19` governs — "一切以 cslh19 的数据为准" — so these are its figures. Quote the
left-hand column. **The right-hand one is history as of 2026-08-19**: the user synced
the authority's store here that day and it was verified identical whole, so this
machine now reports the left-hand column too. The right-hand column is kept because
several figures elsewhere in this document were taken under it and it says what they
are figures *about* — a different generation of the store, whose 18,550-record excess
was not publishable data. §3's preamble has the comparison and the digest that
identifies the state.

**What the D33 migration dropped, and what still needs re-interpreting, is a list
and this plan does not own it.** `THEORY_HASH_REKEY_REINTERPRET_LIST.md` is the
working list, kept current there: of 1,380,494 entries 1,534 were dropped, of which
785 are a genuine loss, and the theories needing a re-collection run are enumerated
with a status column. The site publishes this corpus and D24 and D14 both key off
`theory_constituents`, the very field the defect damaged and the migration rebuilt,
so an export that runs while rows in that list are still `pending` publishes the
gap. Read it before the first export; do not copy it here, because a copy goes
stale and the list is maintained.

**The vector store on the authority is complete: one real vector per entity record,
and not one tombstone.** 1,343,793 vectors against 1,343,793 records. This machine's
7,809 tombstones are a local artefact and must not be used to size anything — the
2026-08-09 reading of 110,329 even less so, which is what this subsection used to
report as 8 % coverage.

At full coverage the vectors are 1,343,793 × 8,192 B = **11.0 GB**.

**Exportable, which is the number the site actually publishes: 1,337,025** — the
1,343,793 entity records less the 6,768 `EXPERIENCE` records, before D24's scope test
runs. §16.2 gives the same figure.

### 3.2 What the DB does *not* contain

- **No position — fixed since, and the fix is deployed.** As measured on
  2026-08-09 the raw msgpack tuples had 6, 7, 8 or 12 fields, all accounted for by
  the twelve named `Record` fields, and nothing carried a position: `semantic_store.ML`
  computed `Position.line_of` only to put it in the interpreting agent's prompt, and
  source text was obtained by asking a **live Isabelle** through
  `PIDE_State.command_at_position`. `ENTITY_POSITION_PLAN.md` fixed this and is done:
  `position` is the 13th `Record` field and 1,092,855 records (80.2 %) carried one on
  `cslh19` when that was measured; re-measured on this machine 2026-08-20, after the
  republishes, **1,327,426 of 1,343,793 (98.8 %)**. The line computation has moved with
  it, to `Tools/entity_position.ML` and `Tools/pide_state.ML`; `semantic_store.ML` no
  longer performs it. Prerequisite C of §12.2 — those positions reaching the published
  snapshot — is **done**.
- **No declaring theory for theorem-alike records.** Their key prefix is an XOR
  pseudo-theory. Matching the first segment of `name` against the constituent
  theories' base names resolves **85.3 %** uniquely, **0 %** ambiguously, and
  **fails on 14.7 %** (≈170 k records) — the declaring theory contributes no
  constant to the statement. Example: `Abstract_Reachability_Analysis.max_Var_floatariths_concat`,
  whose constituents are five other theories.
- **Partial declaring theory for name-addressed records.** The key prefix *is*
  the declaring theory's hash. Measured 2026-08-19 on this machine's 206,010
  name-addressed records — the authority has 199,044, and this arithmetic has not
  been re-run there — they carry **9,188 distinct prefixes**, of which **8,697 are
  persistent** —
  and a persistent prefix is the only kind that ships. The 2026-08-09 reading of
  this bullet, kept because §7.3's arithmetic still quotes it, was that harvesting
  `(long name, hash)` pairs out of theorem-alike records' constituent theories
  yields 8,336 mappings resolving 8,311 of the then 9,148 prefixes, i.e. 192,244 of
  204,741 records (93.9 %), leaving 12,497 records in 837 theories with nothing but
  a theory base name. **That harvest is not needed and is not part of this plan** —
  the Draft 3 correction in the next bullet explains why, and §7.3 states the
  measurement that replaced it.
  **Draft 3 correction.** This bullet then said the theory-hash registry
  `~/.cache/Isabelle_Theory_Hash/theory_hash.lmdb` "does not help: 2,910
  entries, 9.9 % hit rate". Both figures were measured on **this** machine,
  which is not the machine that did the interpreting. `cslh19`'s registry holds
  12,208 entries and resolves **8,702 of the 8,704** persistent hashes that ship
  — 100 %, the two apparent misses being a measurement artefact (§7.3). The
  harvest-from-constituents fallback described above is therefore not needed
  either. `snapshot_sync` did not ship the registry then;
  `THEORY_HASH_REGISTRY_PLAN.md`'s §9 steps 1–3 (landed 2026-08-20) moved it
  into `semantic_DB_dir()` and made `export` ship it, gated — that plan's
  §9 step 4 (the one-off migration on `cslh19`, then the republish) is what
  remains before a published database carries it.

### 3.3 turbopuffer, verified against a live account

Namespaces `isa-tok-semantics-test` (10 documents) and `isa-scale-test`
(230,944 documents) in `aws-us-east-1`. *Draft 3 correction:* the document
text is real, the vectors are not — every document carries the same constant
8-dimension vector, so none of the timings below involved vector search, and
230,944 is **17.0 %** of the real corpus — 18.6 % was against the merged
1,241,679 of the original D5, which D5's reversal replaced with 1,362,343 (§1).

| Question | Result |
|---|---|
| Does `ContainsTokenSequence` match across elements of a `pre_tokenized_array`? | **Yes.** `["a","b"]` matches `[a,b,c,d]` only; `["b","a"]` matches `[b,a,c]`; `["b","c","d"]` matches `[a,b,c,d]`. Adjacency and order both honoured. |
| Is there a negated form for `excludes`? | `NotContainsTokenSequence` does not exist (HTTP 422). **`["Not", <filter>]` works** and composes inside `And`. |
| Does the 4 KiB filterable-value limit apply? | **No.** Accepted 40,000 tokens / 262 KiB, and sequence queries still matched. Namespace metadata shows the field as `filterable: false` with a `full_text_search` config — a different storage path. |
| Speed on high-frequency tokens | `server_total_ms`: `⟹` (in 42 % of documents) **82 ms**; `sorted_wrt` 78 ms; `finite` 9 ms; `x = y` 13 ms; include+exclude combinations 14–20 ms. |
| Cold start | **Not a problem.** After 10–40 min idle the first query reports `cache_temperature: "hot"`, `cache_hit_ratio: 1.0`, 15–19 ms. The 6.3 s seen once was index building right after a bulk upsert. A free `GET /v1/namespaces/:ns/hint_cache_warm` exists. |

`pre_tokenized_array` is confirmed `case_sensitive: true`, `stemming: false`,
`remove_stopwords: false`, `ascii_folding: false` — all correct for Isabelle.

Wall-clock from the developer machine was ~900 ms against `server_total_ms` of
15 ms; the difference is network round-trip, not turbopuffer (§6.4).

### 3.4 The tokenizer, on real data

**Every figure in this block is over §3.3's 230,944-document test namespace, not
over the corpus**, and the two lines that disagree do so because they were taken
against different samples of it — the caveat is now on each line that needs it rather
than on one of them.

```
230,944 documents          mean 39.0 tokens before ASCII symbolic runs are merged,
                           37.0 after (the merge is the line below); max 6,981
distinct tokens            56,336 (in a 150 k sample of the 230,944)
document frequency of the commonest tokens
   '(' ')' 65 %   '.' 53 %   '=' 50 %   '⟹' 42 %   ';' 26 %   '⟦' '⟧' 25 %
merging ASCII symbolic runs changes little   39.0 → 38.5 tokens, 56,336 → 56,455 vocabulary
   but creates 130 distinct operators: '::' **9.89 %** of the 230,944 documents
   (9.1 % was the reading on a 150 k sample of them, and is the number to drop),
   ':=' 1.4 %, '::=' 0.3 %, '=>', '->', '**', … — the last three from the sample
   and shortens the ':' postings list from 12.8 % of documents to 2.4 %
```

The `⟹` frequency in the table above, **42 %**, is likewise over these 230,944
documents; §3.6 gives it as 42.35 % against the same population, and over the whole
corpus it is **617,652 documents, 45.34 %** (the companion's §15.1). Three numbers,
two populations, and nothing wrong with any of them except that two of them used to
appear without saying which population they were over.

Whitespace erasure was checked for collisions across the corpus as it stood on
2026-08-09: **200 collision classes out of 1,353,348 expressions (0.015 %)**, and
inspection of all 200 found **none** whose two source texts differ by anything other
than whitespace. Not re-run on the 1,362,096 of today; the conclusion is a property of
the rule rather than of the population. So
discarding whitespace introduces no semantic false positive on this corpus.

**NFC, measured 2026-08-14 — it was not measured here before.** §5.1, D41 and
§16.5 each cite this subsection for "the store is 100 % NFC", and until that date
no NFC figure appeared in it. The claim is true: `NFC(expr) != expr` for **0 of
1,362,096** records and `NFC(name) != name` for **0 of 1,362,343** — and, re-measured
on `cslh19` on 2026-08-19, zero non-NFC expressions and zero non-NFC names out of
1,343,793, so the claim holds on the authority and not only here. It is recorded
here so the three citations have something to point at.

**`unicode_of_ascii(expr) == expr` held for all 1,353,394 records, and no longer
holds.** Since the loader began reading the symbol table Isabelle actually
presents on 2026-08-17, component files included, step 3 changes **1,056 of
1,362,096** stored expressions — the records carrying a phi-System component
symbol such as `\<big_ast>`. One thing that leaned on the old identity is simply
gone: highlight offsets no longer map straight back to `expr` for those records.
D41's argument for synthetic test vectors survives — see the paragraph on the
export scope below — but its wording needs care, so state it once here and cite
this: **on the published corpus, pipeline steps 1, 2 and 3 are all the identity.**
Step 1 because the store is 100 % NFC; step 2 because the U+007F repair is done
(§12.2 step 1 — the 238 records counted below are the 2026-08-09 figure, before
it ran); step 3 because every record it changes is excluded by D24.

Character hygiene, re-measured 2026-08-19: **one** record's `expr` carries
private-use-area characters, and `name` and `interpretation` carry none.
The one is `IDE_CP_Core.φlemmata`, which holds U+E015, U+E028, U+E057 and U+E068 —
four phi-System word glyphs stored as raw characters rather than as escapes,
presumably dragged out of a jEdit buffer. §3.2 used to state this as a flat **0**,
and D44's argument does not depend on which it is: D44 stops the *conversion* from
introducing a private-use character, and a raw one already sitting in the store is
exactly the case D44 names when it says the reverse direction, `ascii_of_unicode`,
"still names a raw private-use character, because text dragged out of jEdit carries
one and naming it is a repair". D24 excludes this record from the export in any case,
phi-System being neither AFP nor the distribution. Also re-measured: **0** records
contain U+007F, the 238 of 2026-08-09 having been repaired (§10); **835** occurrences
of CR, unchanged.

**Literal `\<…>` escapes, re-measured 2026-08-17, and re-characterised.** The
earlier figure — 1,140 records "for a symbol with no code point", 32 kinds —
named the wrong class. The operative distinction is not "in the table without a
`code:` field" but **"not in the table at all"**, and the two behave identically
for the tokenizer while having very different sizes. Of the 3,562 records whose
raw text carries an escape: 77 carry one that the distribution's table defines
without a code point; 1,056 carry one defined only in `contrib/phi-system/symbols`,
and those are exactly the 1,056 that now convert. Of the rest, **1,980** carry a
word-glyph escape that `contrib/phi-system/symbols-words` **does** define — with a
private-use code point, so D44 leaves it alone deliberately — and **1,078**, in 20
distinct kinds, carry one declared in no `symbols` file in this repository at all
(`\<Empt>`, `\<PR>`, `\<aA>`), which no asset can ever convert. (The word-glyph
figure read 1,981 until 2026-08-19; the four classes were re-measured that day and
every other one reproduced to the record. The four do not sum to 3,562 and are not
meant to: a record carrying two escapes of different classes is counted in both.) The three reasons
an escape survives are therefore different in kind, and only the last is a gap.

After step 3 with the widened table, **3,135 records** still carry a literal
escape, and 17 of those carry one the §5.4 split cuts at an underscore. (An
earlier draft of this paragraph said 1,155, which is `77 + 1,078` — it counted
only the escapes absent from the loaded table and silently dropped the 1,981 that
D44 keeps. 3,135 is also the figure D43 quotes for the subtoken arrays the
character-level rule moves; the two are the same set, and the draft had them
disagreeing.)

**All 1,056 newly-converting records are phi-System theories** — `Phi_Types` 716,
`Phi_BI` 74, `Algebras` 49, `Arrow_st` 46, `Len_Intvl` 42, `Phi_Type` 39, and so
on — and **D24 excludes every one of them from the export**, since phi-System is
neither AFP nor the distribution. So on the corpus that is actually published,
step 3 remains the identity, and D41's argument for synthetic vectors survives
intact for the sample §16.5 draws. The asset must still carry phi-System's names,
or a visitor pasting one would tokenize it differently from anything indexed.

### 3.5 The query embedding is network, not compute

`api.fireworks.ai` resolves to Cloudflare (`2606:4700::…`), so a TCP handshake
measures the nearest Cloudflare edge, not the inference host. Sending a request
with a nonexistent model id forces a round trip to the origin without any
inference, which separates the two.

```
                     edge connect   error request   real embedding   response header
                                    (origin, no inference)           fireworks-server-processing-time
developer machine        10 ms          386 ms          653 ms              0.044
Singapore VPS             3 ms          288 ms          470 ms              0.044
```

**Inference costs 44 ms; everything else is network.** The origin is in North
America — 288 ms edge-to-origin-and-back from Singapore exceeds Singapore's
175 ms round trip to `aws-us-west-2`. Which North American region could not be
determined from outside; the response carries no locality header
(`server: istio-envoy`).

Two consequences. First, D18: putting turbopuffer in North America too lets
Smart Placement run the Worker near both backends, so a request crosses an
ocean once (user to Worker) instead of twice. Estimated end to end for a
European user, ~400 ms today against ~170 ms then. Second, the
query-embedding cache is worth less than first thought — once the Worker sits
next to Fireworks a cache hit saves ~54 ms, not ~650 ms. It is still worth
building, but for cost rather than latency (§11.1).

### 3.6 D21 measured, 2026-08-12

Three namespaces in `aws-us-east-1` — the revised single array, a same-session
control carrying the current two-field design, and a three-field namespace for
the `Or` experiments. `isa-tok-semantics-test` and `isa-scale-test` were read
but never written.

**Read the caveat before the numbers.** Every vector in every namespace here is
the constant `[0.1]*8`, an 8-dimension stand-in. That was not a shortcut: the
pre-existing `isa-scale-test` was already built that way, so **§3.3's published
timings never involved vector search either**, and matching it keeps the
comparison exact. What is faithfully measured is filter evaluation — posting
list traversal, adjacency checking, `And`/`Not`/`Or` composition — which does
not depend on vector dimension. What is **not** measured is ANN search over
4096 dimensions, vector fetch, or cache behaviour at real size: every namespace
here is 40–69 MB and reported `cache_temperature: hot`, `cache_hit_ratio: 1.00`
on every query, where production carries ~11 GB of vectors. These are a valid
relative comparison between field designs; they are not a production estimate.

**Index size**, same 230,944 documents, like for like:

```
                       elements    UTF-8 bytes      distinct subtokens
current, both fields   13,924,220  40,922,175       79,720 (union)
revised, one array      8,711,494  22,164,121       33,363
                            62.6%       54.2%            41.9%
turbopuffer logical bytes: revised 40,332,349 vs control 59,090,403 (68 %)
```

Per document the revised array is mean 37.7, median 23, p90 75, p95 111, p99
258, max 6,427; the distribution is strongly right-skewed with a 4.3 % tail at
≥120. The largest structural change is that **the `.` posting list vanishes** —
third-largest in `expr_tokens` at 53.5 % of documents, and a separator here.
Total postings fall from 5.58 M to 3.48 M.

**The operator conditions D21 exists to enable, and their cost.**
`subtokens(tokenize('⟹'))` is `[]` under the old rule, and §6.3 rejects an
empty array, so these were not slow — they were inexpressible:

```
                    old rule   revised   server_total_ms (median)
'⟹'  (42.35 %)      0          97,807    14
'::' ( 9.89 %)      0          22,849    23
'-->'               0               7    —
```

Single-condition queries are otherwise indistinguishable from the current
design. §3.3's `⟹` 82 ms and `sorted_wrt` 78 ms **do not reproduce**: against
that very namespace they measure 11–17 ms, so those two readings were warm-up
noise of the same kind as the 6.3 s already attributed to index building.

**The one real cost of D21**, and it is a genuine one. Two conditions on the
*same* array are markedly slower than the same two spread across two arrays,
which is what the current design would issue for a partial-name include plus an
operator exclude:

```                              revised, one array   current, cross-field
include 'set'    exclude '⟹'    81 ms                17 ms      (13,050 hits)
include 'sorted' exclude '⟹'    20 ms                15 ms         (287 hits)
include 'type'   exclude '::'   54 ms                14 ms       (3,367 hits)
```

Up to 4.8× for identical results. Field-sharing dominates, not posting-list
length: on the control namespace the same two conditions cost 55 ms on one
field and 17 ms across two, and the cross-field version has the *larger*
include list. The mechanism is **inferred, not measured** — presumably
turbopuffer intersects two `ContainsTokenSequence` conditions on one
`pre_tokenized_array` less efficiently than across two.

**No regression, and one strict improvement.** With the recommended rule, no
case behaves worse than the old rule. The old rule leaves **71 documents with
an empty subtoken array**, unmatchable by any condition at all (e.g.
`Syntax.direction.simps(1)` = `['«','≠','»']`); the revised rule leaves zero.
Two properties worth knowing: a fallback-kept token such as `ᶜᵉ` can break an
adjacent run *through* it, which is a consequence of matching becoming ordered
rather than of the class; and subscript folding widens matching slightly —
`x + y` matches 448 documents against 435 that literally contain the run, the
extra 13 being things like `x⇩1 + y`, which is intended under D6.

**`Or` exists, spelled exactly `"Or"`** — `"or"`, `"OR"`, `"Any"`, `"Union"`
all return HTTP 422. It nests in both directions that matter, verified by
inclusion–exclusion on real data: expr-only 836, name-only 563, `And` 424, and
`Or` returns exactly 836 + 563 − 424 = 975. `Not(Or(a,b,c))` — "exclude this
from everywhere" — returns 229,969 = 230,944 − 975, exact. `And(Or(…), Not(…))`
and `Or(And(…), …)` also work. Cost is roughly additive per field, about +17 to
+20 ms, and tracks the fields' posting lists rather than the result size. A
cross-field `Or` is therefore affordable and **no materialised fourth
concatenated array is needed on latency grounds**.

There is no origin server. The VPS `sg.qiyuan.me` is not in the serving path;
it was benchmarked (§14.3) and rejected for serving.

## 5. The tokenizer — normative specification

**Scope shrank on 2026-08-26** (Q14's final ruling): search no longer tokenizes
— conditions are regular expressions over raw text. This spec's remaining
consumer is the `*_subtokens` columns of the LIVE namespace, which the next
re-export drops; it then becomes historical record.

This is the single most safety-critical component: the stored token arrays and
the query token arrays must be produced by **byte-identical** logic. A silent
divergence produces silently wrong search results with no error anywhere.

### 5.1 Pipeline

Applied identically to stored entity expressions, stored names, stored theory
long names, and every user-supplied filter string. **Every step is the tokenizer
proper and none of them is input-dependent**: the pipeline does not know, and must
not be told, which panel a string came from.

There used to be a step 0 here, stripping one trailing `(_)` from an `Entity Name`
condition so that a pasted `coll(_)` — the invented display form of a dynamic fact
collection's member (§6.1, `from_collection`) — matched the raw stored name. **It is
gone, and it was never the user's design.** What he asked for was printing, and only
printing: "这样数据库中的一切都不用动，只是在 HTML 渲染前端做，或者在返回给前端结果前
做？", and later "前端可以渲染为 `coll(_)` 的呀". The query side was an author's
inference from that, written up as a "consequence" of the rendering in
`DYNAMIC_MEMBER_NAMING_PLAN.md` §2.3 and imported here as a pipeline step; when it
was finally put to him, on 2026-08-19, he answered that it had never been a problem
he wanted solved — "我们不需要解决查询的问题。`coll(_)` 本身就不是合法的查询项目" —
and afterwards, plainly: **"我从没想过检索 `(_)` 的啊，我只是想打印而已"**.

So a visitor who pastes `coll(_)` gets no match, and that is correct rather than a
shortfall: the string names nothing, because Isabelle's own fact selection takes a
number, which is exactly why `(_)` was chosen for the display form in the first
place. §2.3's first consequence must go from that plan too — that plan marks both
of its consequences as "decided here", so this deletes an author's decision and
touches none of the user's; its display half, render `<from_collection>(_)` wherever
a person reads it, stands untouched and now applies to entity pages as well (§9.4).
Removing the step also takes away the only input-dependent step the shared tokenizer
had, which is a gain for §5.5: the Python and the JavaScript now agree on a function
of the string alone, with no need to tell either one which panel a string came
from.

1. `unicodedata.normalize('NFC', s)` — the store is already 100 % NFC; queries
   pasted from macOS may be NFD, whose combining marks are not `\w` and would
   split identifiers. **NFKC must not be used**: it maps `₁`→`1` and `𝐚`→`a`,
   destroying Isabelle subscript semantics.
2. Replace U+007F with a space. §10 has landed and so has D11 — zero records carry
   the character as of 2026-08-19, and `Tools/pide_state.ML` no longer manufactures
   it — so this is a no-op on stored text. It stays because **a visitor can paste
   one**: the character is invisible, it survives a copy out of any editor, and
   without this step it would reach §5.2 as a character with no class and become a
   token of its own.
3. **Symbol conversion, which is two passes in this order, not one.**
   a. Replace each `\<name>` by the code point the symbol table gives it, so a
      user may type `\<Longrightarrow>` or `⟹`. A symbol the table does not
      define, and a symbol whose code point is private-use, are both left as the
      literal `\<name>` (D44).

      **What counts as a `\<name>` is Isabelle's rule**, not a looser one: `\<`,
      an optional `^`, a letter, then letters, digits, `_` or `'`, then `>` —
      exactly the pattern `Pure/General/symbol.scala` uses to name a symbol. Text
      that does not match is not an escape and is simply carried through to §5.2,
      where it becomes ordinary characters. This has to be stated because nothing
      else states it any more: until D43 a `symbol_explode` step re-established
      symbol boundaries after this pass, and deleting it left this pass as the only
      place where an escape is recognised at all.

      The reference implementation scanned with `\<[^>]+>` instead — from a `\<`
      to the **next** `>` wherever it falls. The two agree on every well-formed
      escape and on all 1,362,096 stored expressions, and differ only on malformed
      input, which no sample can reach and which the query box produces on the
      first day: under the loose pattern `\<alpha \<beta>` is one unrecognised
      span and `\<beta>` is lost with it, where under Isabelle's rule `\<beta>`
      converts.

      **Done, 2026-08-18** (`Isabelle_RPC` commit `8b7325e`): `pretty_unicode` now
      scans with `\\<\^?[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_']*>`. That module is shared with the
      whole repository's ASCII-Unicode pipeline, so the change was gated on a
      measurement before it landed — **0 differences over 2,724,439 `expr` and
      `name` fields** of the semantic store, the divergence being reachable only
      from a query box, which is why no sample of the corpus could gate it.

      **This is not the "simplest possible" rule the user settled, and it is not
      supposed to be.** What he settled on 2026-08-18 — "就是直接按照符号、字母边界
      _ . 这些去切分就好了啊，就是最简单的那种切分呀" — is how step 4 *splits into
      tokens*, and §5.2 implements exactly that: `\<=` is one symbolic run, and an
      escape that step 3a did not convert splits into `\<`, `alpha`, `>`. Step 3a is
      the earlier and different question of what counts as an escape worth
      converting at all. His four worked examples are §16.2 acceptance cases.
   b. Replace each `⇩x`, `⇧x`, `❙x` pair by the character the fold table gives
      it, so that `x⇩1` and `x\<^sub>1` become the same text. §5.4's separator
      class is defined over the characters this pass produces, so **without this
      pass §5.4 has no meaning** — an earlier draft named only pass (a) and left
      the fold undocumented while the rest of §5 depended on it.

      **The scan is left to right, two characters at a time, and non-overlapping**:
      take the marker and the character after it as a pair, replace the pair if the
      fold table has it, and in either case continue after the pair. State it that
      precisely, because it decides a case the sentence above does not: when the
      character after a marker is **itself a marker**, the pair is not in the table,
      neither character folds, and the second marker is consumed and cannot begin a
      pair of its own. So `x⇩1` gives `x₁`, `x⇩⇩1` stays `x⇩⇩1`, and `x⇩⇩⇩1` gives
      `x⇩⇩₁` — the last marker folds because the first two paired off. That is a
      parity artefact of non-overlapping matching rather than a rule anyone designed,
      and the user ruled on 2026-08-18 that it is too rare to be worth fixing — in his
      words, **"我认为这不是一个问题，这个 bug 太罕见了"**, with the reason that
      `x⇩⇩1` still round-trips losslessly through `ascii_of_unicode`. Quoted because a
      simplification of this scan was proposed again on 2026-08-20 and had to be
      turned away as already settled; the same proposal will look attractive to the
      next reader too. It is
      still worth **specifying**: §5.5 requires the Python and the JavaScript to be
      byte-identical, and a port written from the sentence above alone would fold
      each marker separately and diverge. Measured on `cslh19` the same day: of
      1,343,793 records, **zero** carry two adjacent markers among the three this
      pass scans, so no stored array depends on it; the case can only arrive as
      pasted query text, where the two implementations must still agree. (The 712
      records that do carry adjacent markers carry `⇘`/`⇙`, the sub/superscript
      *bracket* pair from nested `\<^bsub>` — this pass never scans those.)
   Both tables come from **the asset** of §5.5, and neither implementation may carry
   its own (D45). `Isabelle_RPC_Host.unicode_of_ascii` is the reference.
   **This step is no longer the identity on stored text**: since the loader began
   reading the symbol table Isabelle actually presents, component files included,
   it changes 1,056 of 1,362,096 stored expressions. §3.4 records the old figure
   and the sections that cite it are corrected there. **On the authority's corpus it
   is the identity again**: measured 2026-08-19, this step changes 0 of its 1,336,979
   expressions and 0 of its 1,343,793 names, because every one of the 1,056 was
   phi-System and phi-System is not in that store.
4. Group into tokens per §5.2, **one character at a time**.

**The tokenizer is defined over characters** (D43). An earlier draft inserted a
`symbol_explode` step here, so that a `\<foo>` left literal by step 3 stayed one
indivisible unit, and justified it with the claim that such a symbol "can
therefore never be cut in half". That claim was false of the only level that is
indexed: §5.4 splits at `_` without regard to symbol boundaries, so
`\<^const_name>` became `['\<^const','name>']`. Dropping the step changes 0.23 %
of subtoken arrays (3,135 of 1,362,096 expressions), and 3,118 of those 3,135 are
pure refinements: every old subtoken is preserved or split further, so
`\<^named_theorems>` stops indexing as the unsearchable pair
`['\<^named','theorems>']` and indexes as `['\<^','named','theorems','>']`, which a
visitor typing `named_theorems` now finds.

**The remaining 17 lose a subtoken**, and an earlier draft of this decision
claimed there were none. Where an escape sits against an ASCII-symbolic
character, the escape's closing `>` now merges into a symbolic run with it:
`['\<param>',':']` becomes `['\<','param','>:']`, and the standalone `':'` that
used to be indexed is gone.

**Fourteen of the seventeen are phi-System theories, which D24 excludes from the
export — but three are not, and an earlier draft of this section said all of them
were.** The three that D24 does export are AFP entries:

```
AbsCFCorrect.lemma6                            AFP Shivers-CFA
    ['|','\<PR>','l','|', …]      →  ['|\<','PR','>','l','|', …]        loses a '|'
AbsCFCorrect.contour_a_class.abs_cnt_initial   AFP Shivers-CFA
    ['|','\<binit>','|','=', …]   →  ['|\<','binit','>|','=', …]        loses a '|'
Matrix.matrix                                  AFP Kleene_Algebra
    [ …,'~','\<^cite>', …]        →  [ …,'~\<^','cite','>', …]          loses a '~'
```

Both AFP theories use escapes the distribution does not define (`\<PR>`,
`\<binit>`, `\<abinit>`, `\<aPR>` — they are the 1,078 records of §3.4 that no
asset can ever convert), so step 3 leaves the escape literal and the adjacent `|`
or `~` merges into it.

**Re-measured on the authority's corpus, 2026-08-19** (§16.3 step 1): dropping the
step changes **741** of its 1,336,979 expressions and **none** of its 1,343,793
names, of which **738 are pure refinements** and the losses are **these three and
nothing else**. The figures above — 3,135, 3,118, 17 — stand as the evidence the
decision was taken on and are not superseded; they were measured over a store that
still held phi-System, which is what accounts for the whole difference. The remaining fourteen are phi-System —
`Calculus_of_Programming.φapply_proc`, `PLPR.Premise_const_True(4)`,
`Phi_Types.Param_Annot_def` and their siblings — and nine distinct patterns occur
across the seventeen.

What is lost in every one of the seventeen, AFP included, is **one token of bare
punctuation** — a `|`, a `~` or a `:` that stood alone and now sits inside a
symbolic run. The decision stands on 3,118 refinements against that; it does not
stand on the absolute claim, and it does not stand on the claim that the losses are
confined to material the site never publishes.

### 5.2 Token formation

A **character** here is a Unicode **code point**, never a UTF-16 code unit. The
JavaScript port must iterate code points: 4.17 % of expressions (56,797 of
1,362,096) carry a character above U+FFFF — 4.15 % on the authority's corpus,
55,470 of 1,336,979, re-measured 2026-08-19 — — `𝒮` from `\<S>`, `𝔄` from `\<AA>`,
and 151 of the 624 code-point-bearing symbols in the loaded table are astral (124
of 439 counting the distribution's file alone, which is not the table D45 ships) —
and a port that iterates
code units emits unpaired surrogates, which JSON transports intact and no query
can ever match.

Whitespace produces no token of its own, and it **is** a boundary: `x + y` and
`x+y` are identical because an identifier run and a symbolic run cannot merge in
either spelling, while `f x` and `fx` differ because the space ends the run. Any
discarded character ends the run in progress, which is why `a?b` is `['a','b']`
and not `['ab']`. (An earlier draft said the opposite — "token boundaries come
from the grouping, not from whitespace" — which contradicted both `f x` ≢ `fx`
in §5.3 and the `a?b` line in §16.2.)

- **discard**: any character for which `isspace()` holds, and `?` (D4). Both end
  the current token.
- **identifier token**: a maximal run beginning with a *letter* and continuing
  with letters, digits or quasi-letters. *Letter* = a character for which
  `isalpha()` holds. *Digit* = `isdigit()` or `isnumeric()` (so `₁` continues an
  identifier). *Quasi* = `_` and `'`.
- **numeric token**: a maximal run of digits that are **not rendered
  sub/superscript characters** — that is, digits other than the ones the fold
  table produces from a `⇩` or a `⇧` marker (`⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹` and `₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉`, twenty
  of them). A rendered sub/superscript digit falls through to *anything else* and
  becomes a token of its own, which is what lets §5.4's fallback clause keep it.
- **symbolic token**: a maximal run of characters from
  `! # $ % & * + - / : < = > @ \ ^ | ~` (D8).
- **anything else**: one character, one token.

**The order of the tests is normative**, and each of the three orderings below is
load-bearing:

- *Letter* before *digit*, because the two sets are **not disjoint**: 81 code
  points, the CJK ideographic numerals, satisfy both. So `一二三` is one identifier
  token and not three. D45's asset must preserve the overlap rather than partition
  it.
- *Identifier* before *numeric*, and this is the one an implementer will get
  wrong. **A digit continues an identifier in preference to starting a numeral: a
  numeric run begins only where no identifier run is in progress.** Read as a
  top-level alternative instead, the numeric class claims `x1` → `['x','1']`,
  `nat1` → `['nat','1']`, `list2set` → `['list','2','set']` and
  `sorted_wrt2` → `['sorted','wrt','2']`, which is a catastrophic
  mis-tokenization of ordinary Isabelle identifiers. Of the cases §16.2 held before
  2026-08-19 exactly **one** caught the misreading, and only by accident, which is why
  §16.2 now carries `'x1'` outright and the test-vector file gains it by name (§16.5). Note that `Kelly_1_39` does **not**
  discriminate: both readings give `['Kelly','1','39']`.
- *Numeric* before *symbolic* and before *anything else*, which is what makes the
  run maximal.

**Why the numeric class exists, and why it excludes the rendered sub/superscripts.**
Until 2026-08-19 there was no rule for numbers at all, so a digit that could not
continue an identifier fell to *anything else* and each digit became its own token:
`f 100` gave `['f','1','0','0']`, and a condition `100` therefore matched a document
containing `1000`, because `1,0,0` is an adjacent run inside `1,0,0,0`. The plain
rule — "a maximal run of digits" — was measured over the whole corpus and **loses
content**: 371 records, all of them AFP or distribution material that D24 publishes,
lose a `²`, a `₁` or a `₀`, because a rendered sub/superscript digit standing alone
used to be rescued by §5.4's fallback clause and is now swallowed into the adjacent
run and then discarded by the subtoken split. Re-measured on the authority's corpus
on 2026-08-19: **370 expressions lose a character that way**, and two more change
without losing one, so 372 of 1,336,979 differ in all; no name is affected at all.
The rejection stands on the authority's corpus exactly as it stood on the corpus it
was decided over. `62² = 3844` would index as
`62 = 3844`, and a condition `10²` would match a document containing `1/10`. The
exclusion above removes both defects: measured, 12,822 expressions and 126,282 names
change, **all of them pure merges, none losing or gaining a subtoken** — re-measured
on the authority's corpus on 2026-08-19 (§16.3 step 1) the same quantities are
**12,138 expressions and 121,165 names, and still every one of them a pure merge** —
and
`1 / 10²` indexes as `['1','/','10','²']`, which is better than either the old rule
or the unqualified one. The bold digits `𝟬`–`𝟵` are **not** excluded, because they
come from the `❙` fold rather than from `⇩`/`⇧` and §5.4 keeps the bold fold's
outputs out of the separator class as real content; so `𝟭𝟬` groups, which is a gain.

The `isdigit()`-only and the `isdigit()`-or-`isnumeric()` readings of *digit* were
measured against each other over the whole corpus and **agree on every record** —
re-measured on the authority's corpus on 2026-08-19, still every one of its 1,336,979
expressions and 1,343,793 names: the
only characters that are `isnumeric()` and not `isdigit()` are the ten CJK numerals,
which the letter-first test claims, and `½`, which never sits next to another digit.

**Three defects the numeric class repairs, all measured.** They are the positive case
for it, and none was the reason it was proposed:

- **A whole-part promise this document makes and did not keep.** §5.2 says whitespace
  "**is** a boundary: `f x` and `fx` differ because the space ends the run". Digits
  were the one class for which that was false — `'2 2'` and `'22'` both gave
  `['2','2']`, indistinguishable. They now differ.
- **`39` could not find `Kelly_1_39`**, which is §16.2's own worked example. The
  condition compiled to `['3','9']` while the document held the single subtoken
  `'39'`, because digits do group inside an identifier. It now finds
  `EnrichedCategory.Kelly_1_39_def` and its siblings.
- **`2016` returned nothing at all**, against five records — the
  `verifythis_2016_tree_traversal_*` family — in which it is plainly an
  underscore-separated part of the name.

The same measurement pass gives the noise the old rule created: condition `100`
matched 436 documents and now matches 145, the difference being `1000`, `x1000'`,
`21001` and their kind; condition `1` matched 58,564 and now matches 54,784, having
been finding the `1` inside `4711` and `14`. Every case sampled in the difference was
a fragment of a longer numeral, i.e. a match `COPY.md` §3.5 already promises visitors
does not happen.

A quasi-letter cannot **begin** an identifier, only continue one. So Isabelle's
type variable `'a` is two tokens, `["'", 'a']`, and `_wrt` is `['_','wrt']` whose
first token then disappears in §5.4. Both are load-bearing and neither is
obvious; §16.2 carries a case for each.

The `digit` group of `etc/symbols` — `\<zero>` … `\<nine>` — is **not** consulted
either, for the same reason and with the same measurement behind it: all ten have a
code point, so step 3 substitutes them before token formation sees them, and all ten
satisfy `isdigit()` anyway, so consulting the group adds nothing. This is worth
saying now that the digit class is load-bearing, because an implementer who reads
the next paragraph will otherwise wonder why letters are ruled out and digits are
not mentioned.

The `letter`/`greek` groups of `etc/symbols` are **not** consulted, though an
earlier draft said they were. Re-measured 2026-08-19 against the table Isabelle
actually presents: those groups have **190** members (they had 164 when the loader
still rebuilt the table from `ISABELLE_HOME` alone), and **every one of the 190**
satisfies `isalpha()`, so the union adds nothing; and every one has a code point, so
step 3 substitutes it before token formation ever sees it. The prototype in
`site/prototype/` does consult them — its `_is_letter` unions the group members in —
which is the second of the two ways it is stale (§16.1); it makes no difference to
any output for exactly the reason just measured.

Neither `.` nor `?` is an identifier character. `.` must not be, or
`λx. P x` and `λx.P x` would differ.

### 5.3 Verified equivalences

```
'x + y'          ≡ 'x+y'                 'f x'      ≢ 'fx'
'(- x)'          ≡ '(-x)'                'map f xs' ≢ 'mapfxs'
'A ⟹ B ⟹ C'      ≡ 'A⟹B⟹C'
'⟦?P; ?Q⟧'       ≡ '⟦?P;?Q⟧'
'λx. P x'        ≡ 'λx.P x'
'x :: nat'       ≡ 'x::nat'
'x⇩1 + y'        ≡ 'x⇩1+y'
'sorted_wrt R ?xs' ≡ 'sorted_wrt R xs'
'size Č = 0'     ≡ its NFD spelling
```

### 5.4 Subtokens

A second level, derived from the tokens. Under D21 it is the **only** level
that is indexed or queried; tokens are an intermediate product of §5.2 that no
filter ever sees.

**The rule.** Split each token on `_`, `.` and sub/superscript characters, and
discard those separators. Discard nothing else: a token that is an operator, a
bracket or any other punctuation survives unchanged, because it is a legitimate
thing to filter on. A token consisting only of separators disappears entirely.
That is what makes the user's query `_wrt` compile to `['wrt']` — though not by
the route the wording suggests: `_wrt` is already **two** tokens by §5.2, since a
quasi-letter cannot begin an identifier, and it is the separator-only first token
that disappears here. The example does not discriminate between that reading and
one where `_wrt` is a single token split by the rule, so do not use it to check
an implementation's token boundaries.

```
['sorted_wrt','R','xs']        → ['sorted','wrt','R','xs']
['Kelly_1_39']                 → ['Kelly','1','39']
['Fₒ','Obj','⇩','A']           → ['F','Obj','A']        ← constructed, see below
['x','+','y']                  → ['x','+','y']          ← operator kept (D21)
['⟦','P',';','Q','⟧','⟹']      → unchanged              ← operators kept (D21)
```

*Draft 3 correction.* The third line is **not a real record**, though drafts 1
and 2 presented it as one. No document contains `['Fₒ','Obj','⇩','A']` as an
adjacent run; `Fₒ` occurs in 50 documents and `Obj⇩A` in 44, never adjacent.
Both halves verify separately on real data, so the point the example makes
stands — only the example is fabricated. It is kept, labelled, because it shows
both folding behaviours in one line.

**§5.2's numeric token reads the same fold table.** The twenty rendered
sub/superscript digits are excluded from a numeric run for the same reason they are
separators here: they are decoration produced by a `⇩` or `⇧` marker, not content.
Neither section depends on the other — both read the fold table of D45's asset — and
an implementation that derives one class from the other rather than from the table
will drift the moment the table gains an entry.

**The separator character class**, settled by measurement on 2026-08-12 (§3.6).
99 characters, **derived rather than typed out by hand** — a hand-written class
is exactly what went wrong before. Derived from what, precisely: seven of them,
the control characters, are read from a symbols file; `_` and `.` are ASCII
literals in the rule itself; and the other 90
come from `SUBSUP_TRANS_TABLE`, a 142-entry dict in
`Isabelle_RPC_Host/unicode.py`. That table **is** hand-maintained, and no symbol
file carries folding information of any kind, so an earlier claim here that the
whole class derives from `etc/symbols` was wrong. The consequence is D45's: the
fold table has to ship in the asset, or the JavaScript port cannot fold at all
and cannot reconstruct the class.

```python
from Isabelle_RPC_Host.unicode import get_SYMBOLS_AND_REVERSED, SUBSUP_TRANS_TABLE
_SYMS = get_SYMBOLS_AND_REVERSED()[0]
_SUB, _SUP = _SYMS[r'\<^sub>'], _SYMS[r'\<^sup>']            # ⇩ U+21E9, ⇧ U+21E7

# control characters: a sub/superscript or bold marker must never survive alone
CONTROL_SEPARATORS = ''.join(_SYMS[s] for s in (
    r'\<^sub>', r'\<^sup>', r'\<^bsub>', r'\<^esub>',
    r'\<^bsup>', r'\<^esup>', r'\<^bold>'))                  # ⇩⇧⇘⇙⇗⇖❙   (7)

# the rendered characters the folding produces from a ⇩ or ⇧ marker
RENDERED_SEPARATORS = ''.join(sorted(
    {v for k, v in SUBSUP_TRANS_TABLE.items() if k[0] in (_SUB, _SUP)}))   # 90

SUBTOK_SPLIT = re.compile('[' + re.escape('_.' + CONTROL_SEPARATORS
                                          + RENDERED_SEPARATORS) + ']+')
_RENDERED = frozenset(RENDERED_SEPARATORS)

def subtokens(toks):
    out = []
    for t in toks:
        parts = [p for p in SUBTOK_SPLIT.split(t) if p]
        if parts:
            out.extend(parts)
        elif t and all(c in _RENDERED for c in t):
            out.append(t)                    # the fallback; see below
    return out
```

**The fallback clause is load-bearing and must stay narrow.** A token that
splits to nothing normally disappears — that is what makes the query `_wrt`
compile to `['wrt']`. But a token made *entirely* of rendered sub/superscripts
is real content, not decoration: `ₚₜᵣ` (317 occurrences), `ᶜᵉ` (336), `ᵢₛₒ`
(178), `ₜᵣₛ` (164), `²` (640), `₁` (1,281). Without the clause, 108 such tokens
in **7,346 documents (3.18 %)** become unsearchable. **Every figure carried over
from the 2026-08-12 measurement — that is, every one in this subsection except
where the next sentence gives a whole-corpus replacement — is against 230,944
documents**, the §3.3 test namespace, not the 1,362,096 expressions §16.2 gives as
the corpus scale; an earlier draft named no denominator at all, and a later one
claimed the 230,944 denominator for the replacements too. Re-measured over the whole corpus the
same quantity is **51,891 documents (3.81 %) and 154 distinct tokens** — independently
reproduced 2026-08-19, to the record, under the character-level tokenizer of D43 — and
the raw occurrence counts move too: `²` is 3,955, not 640, and `₁` is 7,023, not
1,281. Measured a third time the same day, on the authority's corpus and with the
production tokenizer: **51,077 expressions (3.82 %) and 152 distinct tokens**, `²`
3,950 and `₁` 6,968. The quantity barely moves with the corpus, which is the point —
the clause is not carrying a handful of outliers. **3.81 % is the whole-corpus figure and the only one to quote outside this
subsection**; 3.18 % is the same quantity over §3.3's 230,944 documents, and §14.7
used to give it as 3.71 %, which was neither.
D41 and §16.4 both used to repeat the 640 as "occurrences in the corpus", where it
is six times low; both now give 3,955 and say that 640 is the count over §3.3's
230,944-document namespace. Restricting it to rendered
characters is equally load-bearing: the obvious unrestricted version ("keep any
token that splits to nothing") was measured and **breaks the `_wrt`
counter-example outright** — `_` would survive, the query would become
`['_','wrt']`, and 130 targets would drop to 0.

**The old class was already wrong, and this fixes it.** The prototype's
`[_.⁰-₟²³¹]` (U+2070–U+209F plus three) covers only **44 of the 90** rendered
characters the folding actually produces. The 46 it misses — `ᵢ` U+1D62, `ᵀ`
U+1D40, `ⱼ` U+2C7C, the modifier capitals and smalls, `ʰʲʷʸˡˢˣ` — occur in
**6,445 documents (2.79 %)**. Measured consequence today: of the 20 documents
containing the token `xᵢ`, a query for `x` finds **0** under the current rule
and **20** under this one.

`❙` (U+2759, from `\<^bold>`) is in the class on evidence, not by analogy: it
behaves exactly like `⇩`, folding into the next character (`❙x` → `𝐱`) and
being stranded as a lone token when the next character has no folding (`❙(`),
in 1,689 documents. Its 52 folded outputs `𝐚`–`𝐳`, `𝐀`–`𝐙` stay **out** — they
carry the letter's identity and are real content. The other 20 `\<^…>` control
symbols also stay out: 14 never occur, and the remaining 6 occur in 11
documents in total and are document markup, i.e. content.

Keeping the old character class while narrowing the discard rule would have
emitted 112,680 separator-only subtokens across **24,654 documents (10.68 %)**,
every one an adjacency break.

Re-verified under the narrowed rule **and** under `ContainsTokenSequence`,
which demands adjacency where `ContainsAllTokens` demanded only containment —
all six adversarial-review counter-examples still find their targets, and the
three operator conditions that were previously inexpressible now work (§3.6).

**What D21 costs and why it is affordable.** `ContainsTokenSequence` is ordered
and adjacent, so a single condition can no longer express "these words in any
order" — `sorted append` no longer matches `sorted_wrt_append`. That intent is
still expressible, because an expression filter takes **several conditions and
conjoins them** (§9.1): the user enters `sorted` and `append` as two separate
conditions, and two single-subtoken sequences conjoined **is** unordered
containment. So the capability moves from an operator to a second condition; it
is not lost. This argument holds whichever control model §9.1 ends up with —
one multi-line text area per polarity, or repeatable single-line rows with an
include/exclude toggle — because both let a user enter two conditions.

### 5.5 The two implementations

The site export runs the Python implementation; the Worker runs a JavaScript
port.

**Both live in `site/tokenizer/`, side by side** — with the asset they read, the
frozen inputs and digest that hold them to each other, and the two drivers that check
them. The Python half sat in the `Isabelle_Semantic_Embedding` package until
2026-08-26. The 2026-08-24 repository split then left the gate's two halves in
different checkouts, each computing a path to the other that no longer existed, and
**the Python half of the gate did not run for two days** — silently, because a gate
that cannot start looks exactly like a gate with nothing to report. The site is the
tokenizer's only consumer, so the pair came here; keeping them in one directory makes
that failure unavailable rather than merely unlikely.

To stop them drifting:

- **One asset, emitted at export time, read by both** (D45). It carries the
  symbol table, the fold table, the letter / digit / quasi-letter /
  ASCII-symbolic / separator sets, the abbreviations the condition box needs, and
  the **`tokenizer_rule` version** that says which rules produced it.
  Neither implementation may hard-code any of it, and neither may consult a
  language built-in for a character class — §5.2 names Python predicates to
  *define* the sets, not to be called at run time.

  **Both implementations must refuse an asset whose `tokenizer_rule` they do not
  implement**, rather than reading its tables and applying their own rules to them.
  That is the one check the digest cannot make for them: the digest guarantees the
  Worker and the index agree on the *file*, and this guarantees the code agrees with
  the file.

  Naming the source files is not optional bookkeeping. `etc/symbols` is not one
  file: Isabelle assembles `ISABELLE_SYMBOLS` by appending, so every registered
  component contributes, and rebuilding the list from `ISABELLE_HOME` instead —
  which the loader did until 2026-08-17 — silently drops all of them. The asset
  therefore records the exact file list and the Unicode version of the classes,
  and `Isabelle_RPC_Host.unicode.get_SYMBOL_FILES()` reports the former.

  **The component files are carried, not filtered out** — the user settled this on
  2026-08-19, and had settled it before: "要带！". So the asset is built from whatever
  `ISABELLE_SYMBOLS` names on the export machine, phi-System's `symbols` and
  `symbols-words` included, even though D24 publishes no phi-System record and no
  published document can contain one of those symbols. Carrying them costs the asset
  a little size and costs the index nothing, while filtering them would make the
  asset depend on a judgement about which component matters — and a judgement of that
  kind is exactly what went wrong when the loader rebuilt the list from
  `ISABELLE_HOME`. As built on 2026-08-19 the table has 624 symbols with a code
  point, of which 135 are private-use and are dropped for the separate reason §16.4
  gives, leaving 489.

- **The namespace name embeds the asset's digest** (D45), so an index and the
  asset that built it cannot come apart. This replaces a run-time consistency
  check: there is nothing to check, because a Worker carrying an older asset
  addresses the namespace that asset built. Since the asset carries
  `tokenizer_rule`, this covers a change of **rule** as well as a change of data —
  which it did not before 2026-08-19, and that gap is the reason the field exists.

- The export emits a **shared test vector file** and both implementations must
  reproduce it exactly in CI — see §16.5 for what it must contain and §16.6 for
  what the gate must assert. Sampling real expressions is necessary but not
  sufficient: **on the corpus that is actually published**, pipeline steps 1, 2 and 3
  are all the identity (§3.4 — step 3 does change 1,056 stored expressions, and D24
  excludes every one of them), so the gate must assert **coverage of named features**
  and not merely a sample size. (Measured 2026-08-19, so this is no longer an
  inference from §3.4: step 3 changes 0 of the authority's 1,336,979 expressions and
  0 of its 1,343,793 names, every one of the 1,056 having been phi-System.) An
  earlier version of this bullet also asked for a test-vector row pinning step 0 —
  that a condition ending in `(_)` and the same condition without it produce the same
  subtokens. Step 0 is gone (§5.1), so that row would pin a behaviour the tokenizer
  must not have; the user settled its removal on 2026-08-19.

- The test vector file is versioned with the data, and so is the asset.

## 6. turbopuffer schema and queries

### 6.1 Schema

```
id               UUID  = a 128-bit hash of the universal key (§6.2); stable,

### 6.2 Document id

The universal key cannot be the id: keys run from 20 to **308 bytes**, and
**85,189 of 1,343,793 (6.34 %)** exceed turbopuffer's 64-byte string-id limit once
base64url-encoded — measured on `cslh19`, the authority, 2026-08-19. (This machine's
different generation of the store gives 89,137 / 6.54 %, and the first reading, on
2026-08-09 and before the re-key, was 88,798 / 6.6 %.)
Use a **128-bit hash of the universal key as a UUID**, and keep the full key as
an ordinary attribute. The hash must be **deterministic**, so that a re-export
upserts in place instead of creating duplicates.

### 6.3 Query construction

Under D21 there is one form for an expression condition, and `ContainsAllTokens`
appears nowhere (**amended twice on 2026-08-26, user-ruled; the second amendment
replaces the first**: a condition is now a **regular expression**, sent — after NFC
and `\<symbol>` translation — as a `Regex` filter over the field's RAW text column
(`name`/`expr`/`theory` with `regex: true`). There is no token-sequence form and no
`ContainsTokenSequence` in any compiled condition; the table below is the record of
the retired form. Design and rulings: §13 Q14, "THE FINAL RULING"):

The two polarities are named `contains` and `excludes` throughout, matching the
toggle the interface shows (D22); an earlier draft of this table wrote the first one
`includes`.

```
contains(expr)   ["expr_subtokens", "ContainsTokenSequence", subtokens(tokenize(s))]
excludes(expr)   ["Not", ["expr_subtokens", "ContainsTokenSequence", subtokens(tokenize(s))]]
contains(name)   ["name_subtokens", "ContainsTokenSequence", subtokens(tokenize(s))]
contains(theory) ["theory_subtokens","ContainsTokenSequence", subtokens(tokenize(s))]
contains(all)    ["Or", [ the three contains forms above ]]                   ← D22
excludes(all)    ["Not", ["Or", [ the three contains forms above ]]]          ← D22
combination      ["And", [ … ]]
```

`Or` is verified to exist, to nest inside `And`, and to sit inside `Not`; the
`excludes(all)` form above returned exactly `total − contains(all)` on real
data (§3.6), and the user confirmed on 2026-08-12 that "appears in none of the
three" is the intended reading. **`excludes` on the `All` panel is `Not(Or(…))` — "appears in none
of the three" — and never `Or(Not(…),…)`, which would be satisfied by almost
every document.** An `Or` across three fields costs about +17 to +20 ms per
extra field, so no materialised concatenated field is needed.

There is consequently **no routing rule, no mode selector, and no fallback
query** ~~— Draft 2 left all three undecided~~, and the "no exact match, showing
word matches" notice that `site/DESIGN_PROMPT.md` requires (its deliverable 5)
exists only to explain a fallback that D21 deletes; that brief must lose it.
**Amended 2026-08-26: one routing rule now exists — the count router of §6.3c**,
introduced because the ANN rank mode silently loses filtered rows (§13 Q14,
"The row loss, root-caused"). It routes between two rank modes over the *same*
filter tree; it is not a second query form, not a mode the user selects, and
not the fallback D21 deleted — the sentence above otherwise stands.

An empty subtoken list must be rejected before it reaches turbopuffer: it would
match everything (D7 also forbids the empty query outright). This is not a
corner case under D21 — a condition consisting only of separators, such as `_`
or `.` or `⇩`, reduces to the empty list, and the interface must say why it was
rejected rather than silently dropping the condition.

**`theory_subtokens` needs a separator.** A theorem-alike document carries a mean
of 7.1 theory names, and `ContainsTokenSequence` matches across the whole array
(that is exactly what §3.3 verified), so a naive concatenation would let a
sequence straddle two names: `[HOL.List, Affine_Arithmetic.Foo]` becomes the
subtokens `[HOL, List, Affine_Arithmetic, Foo]` — under D21 the `.` is a
separator, so it does not even stand between them — and would match a query for
`List Affine_Arithmetic`, which is not any theory's name. Put one separator
token between names. `"\n"` is the intended choice precisely because the tokenizer
discards whitespace and can therefore never emit it, so no user query can
contain it — and it survives subtoken formation untouched, being injected by
the export rather than produced by the tokenizer and absent from D21's
separator class.

**The user chose it, on 2026-08-09.** The proposal put to him was "两个 theory
名之间插一个分隔 token。用 `"\n"` 最稳" and his answer was "赞同", so this is a
decision and not an open implementation detail — earlier drafts filed it under
"small things being decided without further consultation", which was wrong.

**Retired 2026-08-26 with D55.** `theory_subtokens` carries one theory name
now, so there are no two names for a sequence to straddle and no separator to
put between them. `THEORY_SEPARATOR` and step 0b's live probe
(`check_theory_separator`) are both deleted from the export. The record, for
completeness: turbopuffer did keep the whitespace-only element, measured
2026-08-20 and re-confirmed on every export run until the last, and `"\n"`
never had to be replaced. The user's choice of 2026-08-09 was never overridden;
it simply has nothing left to apply to.

Everything above this paragraph is kept as the account of why the separator
existed and how it was chosen, which is what a reader needs if a list-valued
filtered field is ever proposed again.

Index cost. Two sets of figures, and the difference between them is the population,
not the rule — an earlier draft gave the first set with no denominator at all:

```
                    §3.6's 230,944-document namespace   the whole corpus, 2026-08-19
expr_subtokens                        37.72                        39.13
theory_subtokens                      21.46                        24.71
name_subtokens                         6.30                         6.77
```

Quote the whole-corpus column when sizing the production namespace, since that is what
gets built. **The `theory_subtokens` figures are pre-D55**: 24.71 counted every
constituent's subtokens over the records that had constituents, separator tokens
included. Under D55 the field holds one theory name, so the mean falls to roughly
what a single long name tokenises to — a few elements — and this is now the
cheapest of the three indexes rather than the second dearest. Not re-measured;
the namespace it would size has not been built yet.

### 6.3b The query instruction (fixed 2026-08-25)

The text sent to the embedding model is not the query alone. It is wrapped in
the instruction the DB library uses for its own retrieval, so that the query
side and the document side agree:

```
Instruct: Given a natural-language description, retrieve the most relevant Isabelle/HOL constructs
Query: <the normalised query>
```

**The instruction is a constant.** Until 2026-08-25 the last word was a noun
phrase built from the visitor's kind selection — `theorems` for Theorem,
`constants` for Constant, one shared `inference rules` for the four rule kinds,
`constructs` for an empty selection — which meant that selecting a kind changed
the query vector and therefore the **order** of the results, not only which
entities were eligible. The user ruled that out: **a filter must filter and
nothing else.** The phrase machinery is deleted from `worker/src/kinds.js`; a
unit test pins the input text and asserts that a kind argument cannot change it.

Two consequences, both wanted. The interface can now say without qualification
that the Syntactic Filters decide which entities are eligible and never the
order — before this, that sentence was false of the Kind panel, and the copy
that tried to state it was the copy the user could not parse. And one query
text now has exactly one vector whatever the selection, so §11.1's embedding
cache stops splitting on kinds.

What did *not* change: the eleven stored kind values, their canonical order,
the `["kind","In",[…]]` filter, and the rule that an empty selection sends no
kind condition at all (D29 as amended). Ranking under the new instruction
differs from ranking under the old one for any search that selected a kind, so
a deployment of this change re-orders those results.

### 6.3c The count router (final protocol, 2026-08-26; re-review pending)

**What it is.** Every search whose compiled filter tree is non-null first learns the
tree's **exact match count**, then ranks in one of turbopuffer's two rank modes: the
exhaustive **kNN rank mode** (exact) or the **ANN rank mode** (fast, approximate).
"Non-null filter tree" is the predicate, not "carries a condition" — a kind-only
selection routes like everything else. A search with no filter at all is plain ANN
(kNN requires a filter). The entity page's ten-nearest list is out of scope. Since
Q14's final ruling every condition is a regular expression compiled to a `Regex`
filter over the raw `name`/`expr`/`theory` column; `excludes` is `Not(Regex)`
(measured exact and composable); `on:'all'` is rejected while the All panel is
absent from the interface.

**The protocol.**

1. The query embedding and a standalone exact count
   (`aggregate_by {"n": ["Count","id"]}`, same tree, no vector) run concurrently.
2. `count = 0` → the empty response, `mode: "exact"`; no ranked query.
3. `count < 3 % of the namespace's rows` → one **kNN** query; exact.
4. Otherwise → one **ANN** query. Full 200 → serve, tagged approximate. Fewer →
   the result is provably incomplete → one **fallback kNN**, serve its result.
5. Deadlines and retries per the table below; after the table is exhausted, the
   honest error. No degraded serving anywhere; there are no stale rows to serve.

**Deadlines and retries (user-ruled 2026-08-26).** One principle: a leg is retried
on timeout only when a timeout would be **anomalous** — decided before the request
is sent, from the leg's expected cost class. A 4xx is never retried, whatever the
class. **At most one retry per search.** There is deliberately **no total budget**
(user-ruled): the table plus the one-retry rule bound the worst path structurally at
~25 s, which is accepted and recorded here.

| leg | expected cost | deadline | retry on timeout | on transport/5xx | on 4xx |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| embedding | 50–300 ms | 4 s | yes | retry once | never |
| count, kind-only tree | 9–28 ms | 4 s | yes | retry once | never |
| count, tree with a regex condition | ~10 ms–~1.3 s (pattern-dependent; production extrapolation for a weak-literal pattern) | 8 s | **no** — the work is deterministic; a retry doubles the scan | retry once | never — a parse error is the dialect backstop, rendered via COPY §5.8 |
| ANN | 40–65 ms warm; **9.1–9.6 s cold** (four observations) | 12 s | yes | retry once | never |
| kNN, exact branch | 86 ms–1.5 s (one >300 s hang after idle; 542 ms on retry) | 12 s | yes | retry once | never |
| kNN, fallback branch | 5–8 s at the densities where it can fire | **15 s** | **no** | retry once | never |

The 12 s deadlines are sized above the measured cold-start population, so the first
search after an idle gap succeeds on its **first** attempt — no retry heroics, and
no dependence on whether an aborted fetch cancels turbopuffer's server-side work.
The failure copy branches: COPY §6's "the problem is with the site and not with
your query" must NOT be shown when the search carries a regex condition whose count
or ranking leg timed out — for that search the query is the cause and the visitor
has an action (make the pattern more selective); that path gets its own sentence
(`regex_timeout`). **The user approved the error-page ending for the fallback
branch** (2026-08-26): a dense search whose ANN under-fills and whose exact redo
exceeds 15 s ends in the honest error.

**The response contract.**

```
{ mode:    "exact" | "approximate"
  count:   integer   records matching the tree; namespace row count for a null tree
  rows:    integer   records the ranked query returned (BEFORE the D5 collapse)
  complete: boolean  count === rows, decided here in the Worker
  results: card[]    D5-collapsed, as today }
```

`mode` is set at the single point where rows are chosen: kNN rows (and the empty
case) are `exact`; a full-200 ANN result is `approximate` — fullness is not
exactness. **One certificate everywhere**: `rows == min(count, top_k)` is asserted
on EVERY kNN result including the fallback (a shortfall is a vendor-contract
violation and an error, never served), and its failure on the ANN branch
(`rows < min(count, top_k)`) is the under-fill trigger. `count` and `rows` are
record counts, `results.length` is cards (3–9 % apart): COPY §4.5's trigger is
`complete`, never `count === results.length`. The count travels as data and is
never displayed (D29). The `parts` field of the old response dies with
tokenization. Errors: 4xx from turbopuffer carried structurally (status + body,
≥ 2 KiB — the current 300-character slice would truncate the engine's multi-line
parse errors) and mapped to `regex_rejected` (COPY §5.8, rendered through the
existing escaped paths only), `condition_empty` (rejected in `compileRequest`:
an empty pattern was measured to match every row, so D7's rejection must happen
before any request), or `bad_request`; 5xx/timeout exhaustion → `upstream`
(COPY §6) or `regex_timeout` (its own sentence).

**The 3 % line.** A fraction of the namespace's ROW count. The Worker learns the
row count from the asset sentinel, which gains a `rows` field at the next export
(`entities` is the D5-collapsed number, ~8 % low — using it would silently move
the line to 2.76 %). Honest statement of the measured basis: the highest dirty
full-200 overlap sits at 2.43 % (`= y`, 108/200) and the lowest clean point at
2.42 % (`⟶`, ≥192/200) — clean and dirty INTERLEAVE there, so the line is not a
measured boundary but a **margin, 0.57 percentage points above the highest
measured dirty point**, on one index build. The overlap table is per-build (a
byte-identical rebuild moved a related figure 41→74) and per-corpus, so it is
re-established at every release (RELEASE.md step 10) — and since every condition
is now a regex, **the re-establishment must use regex conditions: the existing
table is ContainsTokenSequence evidence, and the M3 sweep (semantically clustered
patterns, a no-literal length shape, a common-literal shape, a CTS-equivalent
differential control, a Not(Regex) shape; recording overlap, under-fill rate and
fallback-kNN latency per pattern) is a LAUNCH GATE for this design.**

**Determinism** holds for the route and for kNN (functions of the data); for ANN
it holds per index state, not per release.

**Acceptance (RELEASE.md step 10, via `/api/search` — a curl at turbopuffer
exercises no line of the router).** The routing half runs against the DEPLOYED
line with two conditions whose counts straddle it (~1 % and ~10 %): below-line
row-complete against an independent count over the whole tree including a kind
selection; above-line within budget. The overlap half (≥ 195/200 against the
below-line run) lives in `worker/probe/live_probe.mjs`, which holds the read key
and issues both rank modes — no mid-acceptance redeploys, ever. The probe's
current check 3 asserts the disproved fullness⇒completeness inference and is
rewritten to the certificate. Both branches' rows carry `$dist` (asserted; D40's
similarity column is computed from it).

**Implementation notes an implementer must not guess**: the two knobs (line
fraction, deadlines) live in `wrangler.toml [vars]`; the count arrives at
`results[0].aggregations.n`; `top_k` does not bound kNN cost (it scores every
match — do not "optimise" it); the `exact` tag assumes a single vector leg over
an immutable namespace (reviving §6.6's dormant BM25 leg or moving to
incremental updates invalidates it); log per search: route, certificate outcome,
both performance blocks, any retry or fallback. Retired, recorded against
re-proposal: the two-knob latency-budget router and the bundled count+ANN round
(superseded by this protocol); the conjunction repair (§13 Q14 — kNN removed its
correctness role, the raw-regex ruling removed the synthesized patterns);
refusal-above-the-line and export-time count precomputation (§14.10/§14.11).

### 6.4 Region

**North America (D18)**, co-located with the Fireworks origin (§3.5) so that
Cloudflare Smart Placement can put the Worker next to both backends. Which
North American region is second-order and **reversible** — turbopuffer has
`copy_from_namespace` — so start with one and measure from inside a deployed
Worker, which can time the Fireworks origin far better than anything from
outside can.

Recommended start: `aws-us-west-2`, on the weak prior that Fireworks is a Bay
Area company. Confirm or move after launch.

Round-trip times measured for the record (TCP connect, i.e. one RTT; a fresh
HTTPS request costs about four times this, but the Worker keeps connections
alive so steady state is one):

```
from Singapore   gcp-asia-southeast1 3 ms │ aws-ap-south-1 62 ms │ aws-ap-southeast-2 94 ms
                 aws-eu-west-2 160 ms │ aws-eu-central-1 161 ms │ aws-eu-west-1 168 ms
                 aws-us-west-2 175 ms │ gcp-us-central1 209 ms │ aws-us-east-1 213 ms
                 gcp-europe-west1/3/4 227 ms
from China       aws-eu-central-1 0.61 s │ aws-eu-west-1 0.70 s │ aws-us-west-2 0.87 s
                 aws-us-east-1 1.13 s   (full query, cold connection)
```

Public regions confirmed reachable: AWS `us-east-1 us-east-2 us-west-2
ca-central-1 eu-west-1 eu-west-2 eu-central-1 ap-south-1 ap-southeast-2`; GCP
`us-central1 us-east4 us-west1 europe-west1 europe-west3 europe-west4
asia-southeast1`. `aws-ap-southeast-1` and `aws-ap-northeast-1` do not resolve.

### 6.5 BM25 over the interpretation

Worth carrying because hybrid keyword+vector retrieval measurably helps
exact-name intents ("the one called `sorted_wrt_append`"), which a bi-encoder
alone handles poorly.

**Stale text removed, 2026-08-14.** This section used to give a second reason:
that BM25 is the degradation path when the embedding budget is exhausted.
**D35 deleted that path** — the user rejected it on 2026-08-14 ("this
degradation is pointless and only adds code complexity"), and every limit now
returns 429. §11.1 already says so; this section did not.

**What BM25 indexes matters for the interface, and it is only
`interpretation`** (§8.1's field table). Not the name, not the entity
expression. So a visitor who half-remembers a name and types it into the search
box is relying on the interpretation happening to contain it — the reliable
route is to type the name into an `Entity Name` condition and let the query
rank what survives. **The interface must say this**: §13b's Isabelle reader
named the required query as the single thing that would send them back to
`find_theorems`, and their need is fully served by the design as it stands.
This is a copy defect, not a case for reopening D7.

### 6.6 How the two legs are fused (D36 — superseded 2026-08-25)

**This section describes retrieval as it was until 2026-08-25.** D36 as amended
that day removes the BM25 leg and the fusion: a search is the vector leg alone.
The paragraphs below are kept because the filter-tree requirement they state
still governs, and because the measurements are the record of what was tried.

D29 locks hybrid retrieval with reciprocal rank fusion; this is the mechanism.

**One `multi_query` request, fused by turbopuffer.** Two legs — the vector leg
over the query embedding, and the BM25 leg over `interpretation` — submitted
together and fused by turbopuffer's own RRF. Fusing in the Worker instead would
cost a second round trip and re-implement what the service already does.

**The filter tree is attached to BOTH legs.** This is a correctness
requirement, not a preference. §6.3 shows one filter tree, and attaching it only
to the vector leg would let every document arriving through the BM25 leg bypass
every syntactic condition — including D22's `excludes` on `All`, whose whole
meaning is "appears in none of the three". A user who writes an exclusion and
then sees the excluded thing in the results has been given a wrong answer, not
a ranking they disagree with.

**The filter runs first, and the 200 are the top of what survives it.** This is the
guarantee the user accepted the whole retrieval design on, in his words on
2026-08-09: "我能接受的是先过滤，得到了 mask 后再根据 mask 选取 top 100" — filter,
obtain the mask, then take the top N *within the mask*. He rejected the alternative by
name in the same breath, fetching a top-N first and filtering it in the Worker, on the
ground that a syntactic filter is often extremely selective ("用户就是想精确定位"):
post-filtering a fixed top-N returns few or no rows exactly when the filter is doing
its job. Nothing in this document may reintroduce it, including as a fallback.

**And it is the one thing here that has never been measured.** Every filter figure in
§3.6 was taken with the constant 8-dimension vector `[0.1]*8`, i.e. pure filter
evaluation with no approximate-nearest-neighbour search involved, so what a real ANN
index does under a highly selective filter — whether it still returns the best members
*of the filtered set*, or degrades to a handful — is unevaluated. That is an
acceptance criterion, not a curiosity: before launch, run a condition that matches a
few hundred documents against the real 4,096-dimension index and confirm the response
returns them rather than a fraction of them, and record the number. ~~§16.8 carries
it.~~ (A §16.8 bullet WAS later written and answered "yes, perfectly" for a
narrow scalar `kind` filter — an earlier revision of this parenthetical denied
its existence, which was false; that bullet's generalisation is struck in place.)
**Measured 2026-08-26, and the fear was correct: it degrades to a handful.** On the
live namespace the condition `f x = x` matches 142 documents and the ANN rank mode
returned 2, 1, 6 and 0 of them across four query vectors. The full account is §13 Q14
("The row loss, root-caused"); the fix — route by exact match count between the ANN
rank mode and turbopuffer's exhaustive kNN rank mode — is §6.3c, and the launch
acceptance check this paragraph asked for now reads: a conditioned query for
`f x = x` returns all 142.

**Each leg fetches 200; the fused list is truncated to 200.** Under D5 those
200 rows collapse to ~182 distinct entities in the response, which is what
D29's "200 results" means — at most 200, no second request, no `load more`.

**The RRF smoothing constant is 60**, the conventional default. It is recorded
here so that an implementer does not have to invent one; nothing measured
argues for a different value, and changing it is a ranking-quality question to
settle against real queries, not a design decision.

**Amended 2026-08-24 — the reader can switch the BM25 leg off
(user-ruled).** The front end offers a control with exactly two states:
hybrid retrieval as specified above (the default, D29's locked design), and
semantic-only — the vector leg alone, one leg fetching 200, no RRF involved,
the filter tree attached exactly as before and the filter-first guarantee
unchanged. The escape hatch this buys: a conceptual query whose wording
happens to collide with many documents' literal words can have its semantic
results diluted by the BM25 leg; the reader decides, per query. D48 applies
unchanged in both states — the single leg has raw scores, and they are still
never shown, so the two states' interfaces behave alike. There is
deliberately **no BM25-only state**: literal lookup is already served by the
syntactic filter panels, and a third state would burden every reader for a
mechanism one panel away — this asymmetry is design, recorded here and NOT
explained in the interface. The control's visible copy needs the user's
verbatim approval before it ships.

~~Unmeasured, and deliberately not a design input: whether turbopuffer bills a
`multi_query` once or once per leg. Cost is not a constraint on this plan
(D28), so it does not bear on any choice above. It is settled by reading
`billing.billable_logical_bytes_queried` off one `multi_query` response.~~
**Measured 2026-08-24, during the Worker build: once per leg.** A two-leg
fused `multi_query` against the live namespace returned
`billable_logical_bytes_queried: 23,971,467,722` — twice the namespace's
logical size — so each leg is billed as its own full-namespace query. As the
paragraph said, this is information, not a design input (D28).

## 7. Theories for filtering

### 7.0 What a Theory Name condition matches, as of 2026-08-26 (D55)

**One theory: the one the entity is written in.** For a name-addressed entity
that is Isabelle's own record, read off the key's 16-byte theory hash. For a
theorem-alike entity Isabelle records none (§7.1 below, which stands), so it is
**derived** from the source position: the file a statement was written in
publishes to exactly one theory page, and that page is named by the theory.

| step | applies to | source | coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | name-addressed | the key's theory hash, through the registry (§7.3) | 199,155 — 100 % |
| 2 | theorem-alike, not a collection member | §17's map: position file → published page → theory | 1,121,637 — 98.40 % |
| 3 | the rest | the theory base name the record's own name (or its collection's) begins with, resolved against its own dependencies, then against the published tree | 17,722 — 1.55 % |
| — | 533 records (0.04 %) | nothing resolves; they match no Theory Name condition | — |

Step 2 never applies to a name-addressed entity even though a position is
usually there: 1,236 of them are declared in one theory and positioned in
another file, and there Isabelle is right and the position is not.

What this buys, against §7.2's own table, is the point of the change:

```
condition            matched by constituents (D14)   matched by the one theory (D55)
HOL.                 1,124,361  (98.6 %)                45,104  ( 4.0 %)
HOL-Library            154,366  (13.5 %)                15,890  ( 1.4 %)
HOL-Analysis            46,938  ( 4.1 %)                15,676  ( 1.4 %)
HOL-Probability         17,924  ( 1.6 %)                 2,658  ( 0.2 %)
HOL-Algebra             29,605  ( 2.6 %)                 7,655  ( 0.7 %)
Jordan_Normal_Form      10,108  ( 0.9 %)                 2,643  ( 0.2 %)
```

The constituent theories are not discarded — they move to their own
display-only column and to the entity page under COPY §8's `Theories of the
constants used`, where a sentence says what they are. What is gone is their
being what a *condition* matched.

**§7.1 and §7.2 below are kept as written.** §7.1 is still true and still
load-bearing — nothing here invents a declaring theory where Isabelle has none;
it derives one from evidence Isabelle does record. §7.2 records the measurement
that made D14 the right decision at the time, and the two alternatives it ruled
out; D55 took a third that §7.2 did not consider.

### 7.1 Theorem-alike entities have no declaring theory (D13)

An earlier draft treated "the declaring theory is missing for 14.7 % of
theorem-alike records" as a data gap needing an Isabelle pass to fill. **That
framing was wrong.** In this data model a theorem-alike entity is
*content-addressed*: its key is the statement's digest under an XOR
pseudo-theory prefix, so the same statement is the same entity wherever it is
written, and what governs it is its constituent theories. There is no declaring
theory to recover, and nothing should invent one.

Consequently **`ENTITY_POSITION_PLAN.md` needs no change** — no 14th field, no
extra work folded into its backfill. An earlier revision of this plan
recommended exactly that; it is withdrawn.

### 7.2 What the theory filter matched under D14 — superseded by §7.0

| entity kind | filtered against | source | coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| theorem-alike (1,137,981) | its **constituent theories** | the `theory_constituents` field | already in the DB, 100 %, session-qualified |
| name-addressed (199,044) | its **declaring theory** | the key's 16-byte theory hash | needs the theory-hash registry (§7.3) |

Measured 2026-08-19: **7.09** constituent theories per theorem-alike record on average
(median 6, maximum 42), drawn from **8,329** distinct theory long names — the same
figure D39 gives; this subsection said 8,299 until today and was the stale half of the
pair. Only four of the 8,329 carry no session prefix — `Pure`, `FOL`, `IFOL`, `ZF` —
which are Isabelle's own base logics and genuinely have none. The counts in the table
above are the 2026-08-19 record counts; the measured rows below it are from 2026-08-13
and are proportions, which have not moved.

The two alternatives were measured against real data and rejected:

```
filter               theorem-alike matched   candidate set,      candidate set,
                     by constituents         D14                 if theorems always pass
HOL-Analysis            50,244  ( 4.4 %)      50,906  ( 3.8 %)    1,149,495  (84.9 %)
HOL-Probability         17,986  ( 1.6 %)      18,254  ( 1.3 %)    1,149,101  (84.9 %)
HOL-Library            159,559  (13.9 %)     161,558  (11.9 %)    1,150,832  (85.0 %)
Affine_Arithmetic        4,213  ( 0.4 %)       4,642  ( 0.3 %)    1,149,262  (84.9 %)
Jordan_Normal_Form      10,291  ( 0.9 %)      10,694  ( 0.8 %)    1,149,236  (84.9 %)
HOL.                 1,136,936  (99.0 %)   1,139,036  (84.2 %)    1,150,933  (85.0 %)
```

Letting theorem-alike entities pass unfiltered pins the candidate set at
84.9–85.0 % **whatever is filtered** — the filter stops working, silently, for
the 85 % of the corpus users mostly want. Excluding them instead removes that
same 85 % from the results. Matching constituents narrows to 0.3–12 %, which is
what a filter is for.

Note the last row: 99 % of theorem-alike statements mention something from
`HOL`, so filtering on a base session has no discriminating power. That is
inherent to the corpus, not a defect of the design.

### 7.3 The theory-hash registry

One name for it, used everywhere below and in §12.2: **the theory-hash registry**.
Earlier drafts also called it "the hash-to-name table" and "the complete hash-to-name
table"; those are gone.

Name-addressed entities carry their declaring theory's hash in the key prefix,
and a per-theory record does exist in `semantics.lmdb` under that 16-byte key —
but it holds only interpretation cost accounting (`input_tokens`, `cost_usd`,
`model`, `driver`, `finished`), **no name**. **11,474** such records exist
(2026-08-19; 11,415 on 2026-08-12).

The table that does map hash to name is a separate store, the **theory-hash
registry** (`hash -> [long name, timestamp]`), at
`semantic_DB_dir()/theory_hash.lmdb` since `THEORY_HASH_REGISTRY_PLAN.md`'s R1
landed (2026-08-20; before that it sat outside the database directory, and
`snapshot_sync` did not ship it — that was the real problem that plan fixes).
`export` now ships it behind that plan's R5 gate; a published database carries
none of it until that plan's §9 step 4 — the one-off migration on `cslh19`,
then the republish — completes.

**Take the registry's location from that plan, never hard-code a path**
(`semantic_DB_dir()` honours `SEMANTIC_DB_DIR`). §8.1's step 4 and §12.2's
prerequisite B both read the registry.

**Draft 3 correction — the table does not need to be rebuilt.** Drafts 1 and 2
said this store "holds 2,910 entries and resolves only 9.9 % of the 9,148
prefixes we need", and concluded it was *deterministically reconstructible* by
one enumeration run over Isabelle2025-2 and afp-2026-05-13 — "a light,
independent job". **That conclusion was wrong**, because the measurement was
taken on this machine, which never did the interpreting. Measured on 2026-08-12:

```
hashes the site must resolve            9,214
  this machine's registry   3,145 →  1,057   (11.5 %)
  cslh19's registry        12,208 →  9,154   (99.3 %)

restricted to PERSISTENT hashes, the only ones that ship   8,704
  cslh19's registry alone               →  8,702  (100.0 %)
```

The 60 that `cslh19` misses are WIP hashes, which never ship; the one remaining
apparent miss is the one-byte global version counter, which `_ships` rejects
anyway. **The shortfall on persistent hashes is zero.** So the "two apparent
misses" §3.2 mentions are these: one is a WIP hash and one is the version counter,
and neither is a theory whose name is unavailable.

**The population has moved since, and the conclusion has not.** Re-measured on this
machine 2026-08-19, the name-addressed records carry **9,188** distinct key prefixes
of which **8,697** are persistent, against the 9,214 / 8,704 above. The registry
arithmetic was not re-run — it needs `cslh19`, which is the authority for it — and the
numbers to quote for the registry remain the 2026-08-12 ones. What a reader should
take from the pair is that the count of hashes to resolve is a little over nine
thousand and a little under nine thousand of them are persistent; the exact figure
depends on which machine and which day, and no decision turns on it.

That is structural rather than lucky: `store_theory_hash` walks
`Theory.nodes_of` at the start of every interpretation run, so the registry
accumulates exactly the theory cones that were interpreted — and the published
snapshot is what those same runs produced.

Consequently the enumeration run is not part of this plan's critical path (keep
`Isabelle_RPC/list_theory_hash.py` and `List_Theory_Hash_App.thy` as the
recovery path if a registry is ever lost), and the interim
harvest-from-constituents fallback that drafts 1 and 2 described — 8,336
mappings, 93.9 % of name-addressed records, with the rest degraded to a
non-unique base name — is not needed.

One caveat this plan must honour: a persistent hash does **not** determine one
theory long name. Byte-identical theory text vendored into a second session
gets one hash under two session-qualified names (measured: 2 cases of 9,214,
both from phi-system's copies of `HOL-Statespace`). See
`THEORY_HASH_REGISTRY_PLAN.md` §3.5 and its decision R9.

## 8. The site export

A batch job producing the turbopuffer namespace from the semantic DB. It must
be re-runnable and deterministic.

### 8.1 Steps

**Written, 2026-08-20: `site_export.py`** (then a package module reached as
`isabelle-semantics site-export`; since the 2026-08-24 migration
`src/site_export.py` of this repository, run as
`python src/site_export.py` — §12.1).
Every step below is implemented, and every gate
below has been run against this machine's store — which is the authority's store,
verified identical whole (§3's preamble). One local pass over the whole corpus takes
9 minutes 19 seconds and produces **1,337,025 documents**: §3.1's exportable figure
exactly, with nothing dropped by D24's scope test, nothing undecodable and nothing
missing a vector. `test_site_export.py` holds the 34 cases that need neither the
store, nor the installation, nor the network.

**Step 7 ran at full size on 2026-08-20** (user-commanded): 1,337,025 documents
into `isasearch-2025-2-afp-2026-05-13` in 3 h 36 m at ~103 documents/s, two
transient TLS resets absorbed by the retry logic, one 37-minute suspension
survived mid-run, and the namespace's own metadata confirms the row count
digit-for-digit. (An earlier 200-document rehearsal namespace had validated
every query form of §6.3 and was deleted.) D49's source-link column is added to
these rows by patch — §17.6 — and rides inside every later export from the
start.

0. **Scope.** Keep only entities every one of whose theories has a session
   prefix in the declared-session set of AFP plus the distribution (D24) — the
   `theory_constituents` for a theorem-alike entity, the declaring theory for a
   name-addressed one. Also drop WIP-prefixed and EXPERIENCE keys, which no
   session test can reach.

   *Status: implemented and measured, 2026-08-20.* Of 1,343,793 records, 6,768 are
   EXPERIENCE and **not one of the remaining 1,337,025 falls outside the scope test**
   — the phi-System and why3/NTP4VC families D24 measured as outside on 2026-08-13
   are not in the authority's store at all. Zero WIP keys, and zero name-addressed
   records whose declaring theory the registry cannot resolve, so no record had to be
   dropped for want of a theory to test it against.

   **The declared-session set is read from the ROOT files, not from `isabelle
   sessions`**, which answers a different question: it enumerates what is
   *registered* on the machine, and on this one that adds 861 of this repository's
   own sessions, every one outside D24's scope. The reader strips `(* … *)`
   comments, because six sessions in the two trees are commented out and a session
   nobody builds is not declared; and it accepts a quoted name, because
   `session "CoreC++"` is a real AFP entry whose name a reader that stops at the `+`
   silently loses — costing 2,915 published records with no error anywhere.
0b. **Settle the `theory_subtokens` separator** (§6.3) before anything is written
   into a production namespace: one upsert into a test namespace, checking that a
   whitespace-only element of a `pre_tokenized_array` is stored and indexed. If it is
   not, pick a non-whitespace separator the tokenizer cannot emit. This is first
   because getting it wrong is only visible as a theory filter that matches a name no
   theory has, and because §8.2 makes every export a fresh namespace, so changing the
   separator later re-exports the whole corpus.

   *Status: measured against the live account, 2026-08-20, and `"\n"` stands.*
   turbopuffer stores and indexes the whitespace-only element: a document whose
   `theory_subtokens` are `[HOL, List, "\n", Affine_Arithmetic, Foo]` does **not**
   answer the sequence `List Affine_Arithmetic`, and does answer `HOL List` — the
   second query being there so that a query mechanism that is simply broken cannot
   pass as a separator that works. The export runs this probe on **every** run,
   against a throwaway namespace it deletes afterwards, rather than trusting one
   measurement: this was made a step so it could not be forgotten, and a check the
   code performs cannot be.
1. **Completeness gate.** Precondition, mirrored from
   DYNAMIC_MEMBER_NAMING_PLAN.md §4: the export must come **after**
   `migrate_from_collection.py` has completed and been verified — §8.2 makes
   every export a fresh namespace, so exporting first would publish 1.34M
   documents with `from_collection` empty and cost a full re-export to
   correct. *Status: discharged — the pass completed and verified on `cslh19`
   on 2026-08-19 (9,597 matched, post-commit verification clean; report
   `/home/xero/from_collection-report.json`).*

   Then assert that every **shippable** entity record has a
   vector. Shippable is `snapshot_sync._ships` — **import it, never restate it**:
   the predicate drops WIP keys, and a restatement of it is what produced the 8,908
   figure the user rejected on 2026-08-12 with "我们应该只考虑 persistent，不考虑
   WIP". An earlier draft of this step said "every entity record", which is the
   rejected predicate. The vector store is a lazy cache and missing vectors are legal
   in normal operation, so the export must **fail loudly** rather than publish a
   corpus with holes.

   *Status: the gate passes.* Measured on `cslh19` on 2026-08-19 with `_ships`
   imported: of **1,337,025** shippable entity records, **0** have no vector, and the
   store holds no tombstones at all. The readings this replaces were all taken on
   this machine and all counted records the export never publishes — 8,908 (2026-08-12,
   before the persistent-only correction), 271 (the same day, after it, and the figure
   the user accepted as the outstanding work), and 7,809 (2026-08-19). The 271 are
   done; nothing here blocks the export.

   *Re-run by the export itself on this machine, 2026-08-20: **1,343,793 shippable
   records, every one with a vector**.* That is the 1,337,025 the export publishes
   plus the 6,768 EXPERIENCE records, which are shippable and not publishable — the
   gate covers everything `_ships` admits, and step 0 is what narrows it afterwards.
   The predicate is imported as `snapshot_sync._ships_predicate()`, a factory around
   the one definition `snapshot_sync.export` also uses. It became a factory on
   2026-08-20 so that it could be imported at all: until then it was a closure inside
   `export`, which no second caller could reach without restating it — the one thing
   this step forbids.
2. **Group.** Compute the `group` hash of `(name, entity expression)` for each
   record. Nothing is merged (D5); the collapse happens in the Worker's response
   after ranking.
3. **Clean** the display text (§8.3).
4. **Resolve** the declaring theory (§7) and the position.
4a. **Copy `from_collection`** from the record (§6.1). It is stored, never
   re-derived from the name: the test that would re-derive it depends on the
   corpus and fails silently on a static bundle whose base happens to name a
   collection (DYNAMIC_MEMBER_NAMING_PLAN.md §4).
5. **Tokenize** into the filterable arrays of §6.1 (§5). `name_subtokens` comes
   from the raw `name`, never the displayed form: `from_collection` is a display
   attribute and the Worker emits one filter for the whole namespace, so it
   cannot route a member row to a different field. **A pasted `coll(_)` therefore
   matches nothing, and that is intended** — the user ruled on 2026-08-19 that it is
   not a legal query item, and §5.1 records the query-side strip that used to be here
   and is now removed. The asset carries character classes, tables, and the
   `tokenizer_rule` version that identifies the rules — but never the rules
   themselves, which live here in §5 and are implemented twice (§5.5).
6. **Emit** the one stamped tokenizer asset (D45, D46) and the shared test-vector
   file (§5.5). The asset is a single file, and §16.4 lists exactly what it carries:
   the symbol table, the fold table `SUBSUP_TRANS_TABLE`, the five character-class
   sets (letters, digits, quasi-letters, the 99 separators, the ASCII-symbolic set),
   the abbreviation table, the `tokenizer_rule` version, and its own provenance — the
   `ISABELLE_SYMBOLS` file list and the Unicode version the classes were built under. "The symbol table JSON" was
   this step's wording before D45 and describes about a fifth of what must be
   emitted; an implementer following it would ship a port that cannot fold, cannot
   classify characters and cannot offer live abbreviation replacement.

   *Status: done, 2026-08-20.* The export builds the asset with
   `tokenizer_asset.build_asset()` and serialises it with `tokenizer_asset.serialize`,
   which is the one spelling of the asset's bytes — D46's guard compares digests, so a
   second spelling would report a change that is not one. What this machine builds is
   byte-identical to the committed `site/tokenizer/asset.json`, digest
   `9f86eadd64f0…`, which is what §16.3 step 2 was waiting for. The abbreviation table
   is not in it and is not meant to be yet: §16.4 defers it to §9.3, which has not
   started. **The committed asset is rewritten only after the export finishes**, so a
   run that fails partway leaves the declaration where reality is.
7. **Upsert** into a fresh namespace (§8.2), then switch the Worker over.

   *Status: exercised end to end against the live account, 2026-08-20, at 200
   documents into a throwaway namespace since removed.* turbopuffer accepted the
   schema exactly as §6.1 asks for it — `vector` as `[4096]f16` with
   `cosine_distance`, the three subtoken arrays `case_sensitive: true`,
   `stemming: false`, `ascii_folding: false`, `interpretation` BM25 with English
   stemming — and the index reported itself up to date immediately after the write.
   Every query form of §6.3 was run against it: an approximate-nearest-neighbour
   search with a document's own vector returns that document first; a
   `ContainsTokenSequence` over `expr_subtokens` matches, symbol tokens such as `⟦`
   included; `name_subtokens` matches; BM25 over the interpretation ranks; the `kind`
   filter selects. **And the separator holds on real data**: a sequence straddling two
   of a record's theory names returns nothing while a sequence inside one of them
   returns the record.

   What has *not* been run is a full-corpus upsert. At 4,096 dimensions the wire
   format is float32 whatever the schema stores (turbopuffer's base64 vector encoding
   is always little-endian float32), so 1,337,025 documents are about **29 GB of
   upload**; §11.1b prices the one-off load at ~$45, or ~$22 with the batch
   discount.

### 8.2 Versioning

Write each export into a **new namespace**, and switch the Worker's target when it
verifies. turbopuffer has no "delete everything absent from this batch"
operation, so upserting into the live namespace would leave deleted entities
behind forever. A fresh namespace also gives an instant rollback.

**The scheme, settled by the user on 2026-08-20** after the naming was found not to
distinguish two exports of the same Isabelle release and AFP snapshot:

```
isasearch-<isabelle release>-<afp snapshot>              the first export
isasearch-<isabelle release>-<afp snapshot>-<n>          every one after it, n = 2, 3, …
e.g. isasearch-2025-2-afp-2026-05-13, then -2, then -3
```

**The generation number is what makes "a namespace that does not yet exist" true
rather than merely intended.** Nothing in the base moves when the corpus does: an
Isabelle release and an AFP snapshot stay put while new interpretation data is
collected, so a refresh cycle under an unchanged pair would ask for the namespace
that is already live, and "write into a new namespace" would become the upsert this
subsection exists to forbid.

**The export allocates it by reading the account, not by remembering anything**: it
lists the namespaces whose names begin with the base, takes the lowest free
generation, and prints the name it chose. The namespaces that exist *are* the record
of which generations were used, so there is no note to keep in step with them. A run
resuming from its own checkpoint keeps its half-loaded namespace instead of taking a
fresh generation, which would strand it.

**The tokenizer asset's digest is NOT in the name, by the user's decision of
2026-08-20 — this amends D45.** What that gives up is stated once, here, because it
is the reason D45 put it there: with the digest in the name, a Worker carrying an
older asset than the index was built with addressed the namespace *that asset* built
and simply found the older index, so the mismatch could not be constructed. Without
it, deploying a rule change and its export out of order gives a Worker that tokenises
queries by one set of rules against an index tokenised by another — **no error, just
wrong results**, which is the failure class §5.5 exists to prevent. That is now an
ordering discipline rather than a structural guarantee. The cheapest way to get the
guarantee back, if it is ever wanted, is for the export to write one extra document
carrying the asset's SHA-256 and for the Worker to refuse to serve when it does not
match its own asset; that was offered on 2026-08-20 and left for §11's work.

**Built, 2026-08-25 (user-ruled: "赞同建").** The guarantee lives in a
**companion namespace `<namespace>.asset`** holding one row — the asset's
SHA-256 (the digest of the committed `site/tokenizer/asset.json` bytes) and its
`tokenizer_rule`. It is a namespace of its own because every turbopuffer row
must carry a vector (measured), so a sentinel row inside the data namespace
would be an ANN candidate; the `.asset` suffix can never collide with a `-N`
generation name. The export writes it after a full run, beside `commit_asset`;
`python src/site_export.py --asset-sentinel-only --namespace <ns>` writes it
for a namespace exported before the sentinel existed (done for the live
namespace, digest `9fadd5c55bc9…`). The Worker hashes its own bundled asset
bytes, reads the companion once per instance, and answers every search with an
error while the two differ. The retirement step of the cycle below deletes the
companion with its data namespace.

**Switching is a Worker deployment, and that is the whole mechanism.** turbopuffer
has no alias or pointer: the namespace name is its only address, so the name lives in
the Worker's configuration and switching means changing that value — one `wrangler`
command, which Cloudflare's documentation confirms is itself a deployment
("`wrangler secret put` creates a new version of the Worker and deploys it
immediately"). It propagates in seconds and no CDN cache is involved, because a
Worker's code and configuration are distributed by Cloudflare's own configuration
system and not served through the HTTP cache. A Workers KV pointer was considered on
2026-08-20 and **rejected by the user as too much machinery**; independently, KV is
eventually consistent with a global propagation of up to about a minute, which is the
one place a real staleness window would have existed.

**This runs on every data update, not once at launch.** The user's framing on
2026-08-12 was a standing pipeline — "我们应该是要构建一条 pipeline 以后每次像更新
数据的时候就执行一遍，对吗？" — and §12.2 is a launch checklist, which is a different
thing and does not replace it. The cycle, end to end:

> new interpretation data collected → the theory-hash registry republished
> (§7.3, prerequisite B) → the snapshot republished from `cslh19`, which is the
> authority (D19) → §8.1's export run against that snapshot, into a **new**
> namespace → §8.1's gates pass → the Worker's target switched → **the namespace
> before the previous one deleted**.

**Keep exactly two namespaces: the live one and the one it replaced.** The
predecessor is the rollback §8.2 exists to give; anything older is neither a rollback
nor a record, only a bill — D31 sizes one namespace at ~11.5 GB at f16, so a cycle
that retires nothing doubles storage on every refresh. Deleting it is a step of the
cycle, not an operator's habit, because §8.2's "always write into a fresh namespace"
rule is what creates the garbage. Retiring the predecessor is this author's rule
implementing the user's pipeline, and the only part of the cycle he has not
separately settled.

**The asset's `tokenizer_rule` version is inside its bytes, so its digest moves when
a rule changes and not only when data does** (D45 as amended 2026-08-19). That
digest no longer names the namespace — the 2026-08-20 amendment above took it out —
but it is still what D46's guard compares, so a rule change that touches no table,
§5.2's numeric token class being the worked example since it reuses the digit set the
asset already ships, is still seen. **Bumping `tokenizer_rule` is a manual act and
belongs in the same commit as the rule change**; §16.6's gate is where a forgotten
bump is caught, because the digest of the two implementations' output over the
committed inputs moves at the same time and neither implementation can then reproduce
`expected.json`.

**And the export must fail rather than quietly export under a changed asset (D46).**
This paragraph read "rather than silently rename the namespace" until 2026-08-20,
which was true while the digest was in the name and is not any more. What a changed
asset now does silently is worse, not better: the namespace name does not move at
all, so an unnoticed component change would publish an index tokenised by one table
under a name a Worker holding another table addresses. D46
requires that "an export that finds a different component set than the declared one
must fail", and never said where the declaration lives. It is the **committed asset
from the previous export**: the export recomputes the asset from the live
installation and compares its `ISABELLE_SYMBOLS` file list, its `tokenizer_rule`
version and its digest against that file, and stops if any of the three differs
unless it is told on the command line that the change is intended. The
`tokenizer_rule` comparison is what makes this guard see a rule change at all; before
2026-08-19 it compared only the file list and the digest, both of which a rule change
leaves untouched. No second declaration file is introduced, because the invariant
that matters — the committed asset is the deployed asset — is exactly what makes the
comparison meaningful, and a separate list of expected components would be a second
thing to keep in step. The first export has nothing to compare against and writes the
baseline; from the second onwards, registering or unregistering an Isabelle component
is a loud failure rather than a quiet one.

### 8.3 Display cleaning

```python
def clean_for_display(expr):
    expr = repair_del(expr)          # §10.2; a no-op once the DB is repaired
    return expr.replace('\r\n', '\n').replace('\r', '\n')
```

The 835 CR occurrences affect display only, and search is unaffected — but for a
different reason than an earlier draft gave. That draft said `symbol_explode` folds
CR to LF and the tokenizer then discards the LF; D43 deleted `symbol_explode`, so
that route is gone. The conclusion survives on the simpler ground that `'\r'`
satisfies `isspace()`, so §5.2 discards it and it ends the run in progress exactly as
a newline or a space does. The `replace` above is therefore about what a card shows,
not about what matches.

## 9. The front end — phase two (D32)

This section records the design that was agreed, so that it does not have to be
re-derived later. It was written under D20, which deferred the web application
outright; **D20 is superseded by D32**, which lifts the deferral and stages the work
instead — the whole data side first (§12.2 steps 1-5), the interface after. So
nothing here is to be built until phase one's export answers queries correctly, but
this is scheduled work rather than shelved work, and its design is settled to
D22/D26/D29/D30 with a mockup at `site/design/IsaSearch.dc.html`. The authoritative
source for every visitor-facing string is `site/COPY.md`, never this section.

A reader working on the backend can skip to §11; §10 is a four-line pointer into the
companion file.


### 9.1 Layout

One prominent box for the semantic query, plus a collapsible panel for the
syntactic filters: the five panels of D22 — `Entity Name`, `Expression`,
`Theory Name`, `All`, `Kind` — where the first three and `All` are repeatable
lists of single-line conditions, each condition carrying its own
`contains`/`excludes` toggle, and `Kind` is a chip group.

**There is no inline query syntax, and none may be designed.** A draft-1
paragraph here offered one — `sorted_wrt -inductive theory:HOL-Library`, parsed
and echoed back into the structured fields — and D22 replaced it with the panel
list above without deleting it. `site/DESIGN_PROMPT.md`, the designer brief
(§12.1), forbids it in as many words: "A condition may freely contain spaces and
any punctuation … there is **no escaping and no inline operator syntax; do not
design one**." A condition is one line of literal text; the only structure is
which panel it sits in and which way its own toggle is set.

### 9.1b How the mockup is changed, when it has to be

Two rules, both the user's, on 2026-08-12: "你能改进设计稿吗？用同样的样式和结构，
单纯复制粘贴".

- **When `site/DESIGN_PROMPT.md` and the mockup disagree about the control model,
  the mockup is what gets edited.** That is the opposite direction from the copy
  rule, where the mockup follows `site/COPY.md` and never the reverse (§12.1) — the
  two are not in conflict because they are about different things, the brief and the
  mockup being about controls and `COPY.md` being about words.
- **Edit it by replicating its own existing styles and structure — copy and paste,
  design nothing new.** The delivered mockup is a Claude Design artefact with a
  generated runtime that is not edited (§12.1); new markup authored against it drifts
  from everything around it.

This matters now because `SEMANTIC_SEARCH_SITE_PLAN_DONE.md` §15.5 lists four defects
still in the mockup — a `load 8 more` control and a total match count that D29
forbids, an empty Kind chip default against D29, and pagination at 8 rather than 20 —
and whoever fixes them works under these two rules.

### 9.2 A required piece of user education

`ContainsTokenSequence` is **literal adjacent matching, not pattern matching**.
Users type a pattern, expect Isabelle pattern semantics, and conclude the site is
broken.

**The measurement, corrected.** An earlier draft of this subsection said `?P ⟹ ?Q`
returns 1 document. It returns **60** (D37, and the companion's §15.1 table), because
`P` and `Q` really are common variable names and D4 discards the `?` that would have
distinguished them. The example that makes the point honestly is
**`?n + ?m = ?m + ?n`, which returns 0** while commutativity of addition is certainly
in the index — the condition fails for exactly one reason, that the variable names
differ, and nothing else has to be explained. `?a + ?b = ?b + ?a` returns 15, one of
them `Groups.ab_semigroup_add_class.add.commute`, which is the pair that makes the
reason visible. `site/COPY.md` is built on that pair and is authoritative for the
wording; do not rebuild the empty state from this paragraph.

Therefore: never label this feature "pattern"; and when a syntactic filter
returns nothing, say explicitly that the filter is literal and does not support
variable placeholders.

### 9.2b The theory filter means two things, and says so (D15)

Per D14 the theory filter matches a name-addressed entity's declaring theory
but a theorem-alike entity's constituent theories. The interface states this
rather than hiding it. One sentence carries it, shown beside the field **in
amber** — the user proposed red on 2026-08-12 and settled on amber the same
afternoon ("琥珀色挺好的"), so it is an emphasised callout and not body text.
The mockup already renders it that way; the exact string is `site/COPY.md` §3.4:

> **Theory Name** — matches an entity's **associated theories**: for constants,
> types, classes, locales and methods, the theory that declares them; for
> theorems, the theories of the constants their statement uses.

The field's own label is **`Theory Name`**, fixed by D22, which records that the bare
`Theory` was argued for and rejected — an earlier draft of this subsection used the
bare form in both the label and the sentence. The plural sense is carried by this
sentence, not by the label.

Nothing about this is offered as an option or a mode: the alternatives were
measured and are worse (§7.2).

### 9.3 Fonts

`⟹ ⟦ ⟧ 𝔍 ℭ ₁` render as tofu in most default fonts. The Isabelle
distribution's `IsabelleDejaVu` family must be subsetted to WOFF2 and embedded.
This is easy to miss because a developer's own machine has the fonts installed.

Input needs three routes: pasting Unicode; typing the ASCII escape
`\<Longrightarrow>` (already handled by the tokenizer); and live abbreviation
replacement (`==>` → `⟹`).

**Correction, 2026-08-14.** The abbreviations are **not** in a file named
`etc/abbrevs` — no such file exists in the distribution. They are the `abbrev:`
fields of `etc/symbols` itself, e.g. line 189
`\<Longrightarrow>  code: 0x0027f9  group: arrow  abbrev: .>  abbrev: ==>`.
So the export emits them from the table it already reads, and the site needs no
second asset.

The distinction matters for the copy, and §13b's draft got it wrong: the
tokenizer does **not** convert `==>`. Measured — `tokenize('==>')` returns
`['==>']`, an ASCII symbolic token, which matches `⟹` nowhere. Only the escape
`\<Longrightarrow>` is converted, by `unicode_of_ascii` in step 2. `==>` works
solely because the input control replaces the text in the box before the
condition is ever sent. The interface may therefore say *"the box turns `==>`
into `⟹` while you type"*; it may never say that `==>` **is** `⟹`. A second
consequence: an abbreviation with more than one expansion (`.>` and `<.` each
serve four or more arrows) cannot be replaced without asking, so live
replacement covers the unambiguous abbreviations only.

### 9.4 Entity pages

One server-rendered page per **record** at a stable URL, `/entity/<universal
key, base64url>` (D9 as amended 2026-08-25; the paragraph "The page identity
is `group`" below records the superseded ruling), carrying name, kind,
theories, expression, interpretation, source link, and a "related entities"
block computed from the ten nearest vectors
to the record's own vector — which turbopuffer returns on request
(`include_attributes: ["vector"]`, measured 2026-08-25).

**The `from_collection` display rule applies here too**, not only to result cards: a
page whose record carries the field shows `<from_collection>(_)` in place of the
stored name (§6.1). The user's instruction named the front end, not one widget —
"前端可以渲染为 `coll(_)` 的呀" — and these pages are the crawlable, permanent surface
D25 ships in the first release, so a page is precisely where showing the enumeration's
invented name, `tendsto_intros(104)`, would be indexed and quoted. The related block is not decoration: it is
what keeps these pages from being classed as thin content.

**Superseded 2026-08-25 — the page identity is the record (D9 as amended); the
paragraph is kept for the reasoning it records.** ~~The page identity is `group`, not the site document~~, and an earlier draft of D9
and of this subsection said "one per site document". Under D5 as reversed there is
one site document per *record*, and cross-kind duplicates — the same
`(name, entity expression)` recorded once as a `Theorem` and again as an
`Introduction rule` — are several records. They collapse into one card after ranking,
and the thing that card links to is one page. §6.1 already says so: `group` is "the
identity of the entity page (§9.4) and the key the response collapses on".

Search results must link to these URLs from day one even if the pages ship
later, so the URL scheme never has to change and no inbound links are lost.

Sitemaps must be sharded (50 k URLs each, so ≥28 shards plus an index). Crawl budget
will not cover ~1.36 M pages on a new site, so the sitemap is ordered rather than
arbitrary: **the distribution's own sessions first, then AFP, and inside each the
199,044 name-addressed entities before the theorem-alike ones**, since a
name-addressed entity carries a name a person might actually search for. An earlier
draft said "prioritise HOL and widely-used AFP entries", which is not actionable —
no record field records use, and this plan defines no popularity signal. If one is
ever wanted the only honest source is the site's own request log, which does not
exist before launch.

### 9.5 Rendering

Server-rendered from the Worker rather than a client-side application: entity
pages need it for indexing, it works without JavaScript, and the page structure
is simple enough that a framework earns nothing.

## 10. Repairing U+007F — done

Done, and moved to `SEMANTIC_SEARCH_SITE_PLAN_DONE.md` §10, taking §10.1 (the root cause)
and §10.2 (the repair) with it — citations to either resolve there. Zero of 1,362,343 records still carry U+007F, measured
2026-08-12. §5.1's pipeline step 2 is retained and is now a no-op on stored text.

## 11. Operations

### 11.1 Abuse protection (D35)

Not a spend control — D28 cancelled the budget. This exists because an
anonymous public endpoint that spends someone else's API credit needs a bound
against hammering and runaway clients. Two layers are built; a third is
specified but deliberately not built.

**Layer 1 — one Cloudflare edge rate limiting rule, per IP, 5 requests per
10 seconds.** The number is the user's, on 2026-08-14: "第一层建议每 10 秒 5 次 …
其他都赞成，请写进计划". The zone stays on the **Free** plan, which includes exactly
one rule, counting by `ip.src`, with a 10-second period — all this layer needs.
Excess requests are rejected at the edge and never reach the Worker.

**Do not tighten this layer, and be careful what "looser" means.** On 2026-08-12 he
settled 12 per IP per minute — "很好的问题，每 IP 每分钟限流12次。就这么定" — and on
2026-08-13, asked whether it could come down to 8 per minute, answered "强烈反对".
Sustained, 5 per 10 seconds is 30 a minute and looser than either; **in burst it is
stricter than both**, since a visitor firing six quick searches trips at the fifth
where 12 a minute would have passed all twelve. That change of shape rode in on an
implementation constraint — KV's one-write-per-second-per-key ceiling — which is the
move he refused. It stands because he set 5-per-10-seconds himself afterwards, not
because the plumbing required it, and a future proposal to lower it is re-opening a
question he has already closed twice.

**Layer 2 — a per-IP daily counter, 1,000 requests per UTC day.** ~~In Workers
KV: key `rl:<hash of the IP>:<YYYY-MM-DD>`, TTL ~26 h so it expires itself. The IP
is stored **hashed with a rotating salt, never in the clear**~~ — **amended
2026-08-25 (user-ruled) after the Worker's adversarial review**: a KV counter is
a non-atomic read-modify-write behind a read cache of at least 60 s, so it could
not deliver the exact "1 000" COPY §7 promises. The counter now lives in **one
Durable Object for the whole site** (`DailyGate`, SQLite-backed): requests to it
execute one at a time, so `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET count = count + 1
RETURNING count` is atomic and the count exact. Table `counters (day, ip_hash,
count, country, asn)`, rows older than yesterday dropped on the day's first
request; table `daily (day, searches, rejected, addresses)` kept for good as the
site's **usage statistics** (a new purpose, user-ruled the same day). The IP is
stored only as `SHA-256(salt | ip)` under a **fixed** secret salt — fixed, not
rotating, so a returning address counts as the same address; still never in the
clear, and no row can be turned back into an address. `country` and `asn` come
from Cloudflare's own request metadata (`cf.country`, `cf.asn`; the AS name is
not stored). No query text is ever stored. On trip: 429 with `Retry-After` set
to UTC midnight. The Durable Object's home is placed on first access, next to
the Smart-Placed Worker in North America (D18). Layer 3 remains unbuilt; this
object counts per address only.

**Layer 1 is what makes layer 2 work, and must not be removed as redundant.**
~~KV limits writes to a *single key* to 1 per second, on every plan, and one IP's
counter is one key. Without layer 1 a client hammering at 10 requests/second
would have most of its increments dropped and the counter would under-count
precisely against the behaviour it exists to catch.~~ (The KV argument is moot
under the 2026-08-25 amendment; the Durable Object counts exactly at any rate.)
Layer 1 still stands as the burst bound — layer 2 only counts per day — and
caps the sustained rate at 0.5 requests/second. **Its scope, settled 2026-08-25:
the edge rule applies to `/api/search` only.** §17.8 put the published tree
behind the same domain, and a cold source page is HTML + CSS + several of the 13
`@font-face` files inside one second — a rule over the whole domain would 429
visitors on their own fonts. The threshold is not reopened by this.

**Layer 3 — a global gate, specified and not built, with the user's agreement.**
The gate was his own instruction, on 2026-08-13 and ninety seconds after he cancelled
the $5-a-day spend cap: "此外加一个闸门，全服务器每小时最多 10000 次请求。你觉得够了
吗？" — a replacement safeguard for the one he had just removed. Its absence is his
call too, taken on 2026-08-19 when the daily per-IP limit was on the table: "不需要每
小时的闸门了，我们已经有每天的闸门了" and "接受没有全局上限". **So the site ships with
no global bound, and that is a decision, not an omission** — earlier drafts of this
paragraph argued it as the author's complexity trade-off ("the only piece here needing
a new stateful component"), which put the attribution the wrong way round on a
question about someone else's API credit.

What stays specified, so that building it later needs no new design: a global counter
cannot live in KV — it is a single key and the site-wide rate would sit around 3
requests/second, straight into the same 1-write-per-second limit — nor in a Cloudflare
edge rule, which counts per data centre (§14.8). It needs a Durable Object holding a
token bucket: refill 2.78 tokens/second (10,000/hour) with a burst capacity, and a 429
when empty, never a fixed hourly quota that can be exhausted early and leave the site
dark for the rest of the hour. Revisit from the Worker's own telemetry (§11.2), not
from speculation — which is why §11.2 requires every 429 to be logged with the layer
that produced it.

**On a trip, every layer returns 429 with `Retry-After`** and an interface
message naming which limit was hit. There is **no degradation to BM25**: BM25
over machine-written English is a materially worse search, and serving a
plausible-looking second-rate result set to a user who cannot tell is worse
than an honest "too busy, try again" (D35). BM25 remains a normal leg of the
hybrid query (D29) — what is rejected is the *fallback mode*, not the feature.

**Recurring cost of all of this**: Workers Paid at $5/month, which KV writes
require and which includes 1 M writes and 10 M reads per month — enough for
~33,000 searches a day before any overage. The Cloudflare zone itself stays
free. Cloudflare Pro ($20/mo) and Business ($200/mo) buy nothing this design
needs; the only thing that would ever justify Business is
`cf.unique_visitor_id`, which distinguishes visitors behind one NAT address and
would matter if university networks turn out to be widely throttled as one
client. Enterprise, whose only relevant advantage is a 3,600-second counting
period, is reported to start around $3,000–5,000/month and is out of the
question.

**Two things unverified, with the procedure for each.** Neither is settled by
reading more documentation.

1. *Does the Free plan's single rate-limiting rule accept a threshold of 5?* The
   documentation states the period and the characteristic and not the permitted
   thresholds. **Procedure:** create the rule in the zone's Security → WAF →
   Rate limiting rules with `ip.src`, period 10 s, threshold 5, and read back what
   the dashboard saved. If 5 is rejected, take the lowest accepted value and redo
   layer 1's arithmetic — the number that has to survive is the sustained rate
   staying under KV's 1 write per second per key.
2. *What request allowance does Workers Paid include?* The figure quoted above —
   1 M KV writes and 10 M reads a month, enough for ~33,000 searches a day —
   comes from Cloudflare's published plan comparison and is **not** verified against
   a live account. **Procedure:** subscribe, then read the Workers → Usage panel,
   which reports the included allowance and the overage rate for the account
   actually being billed. Until then treat the 33,000/day as an estimate.

A **query-embedding cache in Workers KV**, keyed on the normalised query
string, remains worth building: search traffic is strongly Zipf-distributed, so
it removes more Fireworks calls than any rate limit and cuts latency on a hit.
**"Normalised" defined, 2026-08-25 (user-ruled):** NFC, then trimmed, then every
inner run of whitespace folded to one space — and nothing more; case folding or
punctuation stripping would change retrieval. The Worker applies it once, and
the embedding input and the cache key both see that one string. The key is the
SHA-256 of the whole instruction-wrapped text (§6.3b's template), which since
2026-08-25 varies only with the query: **the instruction is fixed**, so one
query text has one vector however the kinds are selected, and the cache is hit
far more often than when the phrase varied. The kind selection is still
canonicalised (deduplicated, fixed order, all eleven ≡ none) for the filter.
**Cloudflare Turnstile** stays in reserve if the two built layers prove
insufficient.

### 11.1b What it costs, measured against the published price lists (2026-08-13, recomputed 2026-08-19)

**This section is capacity information, not a constraint (D28).** It is here so
that a runaway is recognisable and so that a future decision about corpus size
or vector dtype can be taken with the numbers in view. No decision in this plan
is justified by it, and none may be reversed on its account.

**turbopuffer bills every query as if it read the whole namespace.** Not per
document scanned, not per byte actually touched — the FAQ's words are "data
queried is calculated as the actual size of the queried namespace or 1.28 GB,
whichever is greater". Three consequences that shape this design:

- **Per-search cost is proportional to corpus size**, not logarithmic in it.
  Every document added makes every future search dearer.
- **Filters are free and selectivity buys nothing.** A condition narrowing the
  candidate set to 500 documents still bills the full namespace. So D21's
  collapse to one array, and D22's `All` panel with its three-field `Or`, cost
  nothing on this meter — only on latency (§3.6).
- **The vector dimension is the dominant lever on price**, because the vectors
  are ~97 % of the namespace.

Rates: storage $0.33/GB-month; data queried $1/PB; data returned $0.05/GB;
writes $2/GB with a batch discount reaching 50 % at ~3.1 MB per batch; plan
floor $16/month. Enterprise adds a 35 % usage premium. Logical bytes are
billed, so index amplification is not passed through.

**Corrected 2026-08-19: the base and the returned-data term were both wrong.** This
subsection was computed on 1,241,679 site documents, which is the *merged* count from
the original D5 — and D5 was reversed on 2026-08-13, making it one document per
record, **1,362,343**.

**Every figure in this subsection is computed on that 1,362,343, which is this
machine's pre-re-key count** (§3's preamble). The authority publishes **1,337,025**
documents, 1.9 % fewer, so every size and price below is an over-estimate by about
that margin — 10.95 GB of f16 vectors rather than 11.16 GB. The model is deliberately
**not** recomputed: nothing any decision here turns on moves by 1.9 %, and re-deriving
a dozen figures to shave it would risk more than it fixes. Recompute it when the
first export reports the number it actually wrote. And the returned-data term was taken as ~20 KB where D29
measures a 200-result response at **~200 KB**, an order of magnitude, which made the
per-search total $0.000022 against D29's internally consistent $0.000031. Everything
below is recomputed on the reversed D5 and D29's payload.

At 1,362,343 site documents × 4096 dimensions × 4 bytes the vectors are 22.32 GB and
the namespace ~23 GB. At D31's f16 — which is what actually ships — they are 11.16 GB
and the namespace ~11.5 GB:

```
f32, for comparison only
per search   23 GB queried  $0.000023   +  ~200 KB returned  $0.000010  =  $0.000033
per day      10 k searches $0.33   100 k $3.30   1 M $33.00
per month    storage $7.59; initial load at 4 B/dim for writes, 22.3 GB x $2 = $45, or $22 batched
             [WRONG — measured 2026-08-25 on the real invoice: the whole Aug 9–Sep 1 period,
              full export and source_link patch included, billed writes at $0.07 total;
              a full export costs cents, not $45. The $16 monthly minimum is never reached:
              the period's usage was $1.24.]

f16, as shipped (D31)
per search   11.5 GB queried $0.0000115 +  ~200 KB returned  $0.000010  =  $0.0000215
per day      10 k searches $0.22   100 k $2.15   1 M $21.50
per month    storage $3.80; the one-off load is unchanged at ~$45 / ~$22 batched,
             because turbopuffer counts 4 bytes per dimension for writes whatever the dtype
```

Two things change qualitatively. The queried term is no longer 95 % of a search: at
f16 it is 53 %, and **the response payload is now the other half**, which is a reason
to keep D29's 200-result bound and no reason to shrink the vector further. And the
$16 monthly floor absorbs everything below roughly **24,000 searches a day at f16**
(about 16,000 at f32), so marginal searches are free until then — the earlier
"13,600 a day" inherited both errors.

**Reducing the vector changes this by up to 16×**, because namespace size *is*
the per-query price. turbopuffer counts f16 at 2 bytes per dimension and i8 at
1 (for storage and queries; writes still count 4). Recomputed on 1,362,343
documents, and showing the **queried** term alone so the four rows are comparable —
the ~$0.000010 returned-data term is the same in every row and does not shrink with
the vector:

```
                        namespace   queried, per M searches   storage / month
4096-d f32               23.00 GB    $23.00                    $7.59
4096-d f16 (D31, ships)  11.50 GB    $11.50                    $3.80
1024-d f32                5.75 GB     $5.75                    $1.90
1024-d i8                 1.44 GB     $1.44                    $0.48
```

The namespace column is the vectors plus 3 %, which is the ratio the two 4096-d rows
were measured at; the vectors themselves are 22.32, 11.16, 5.58 and 1.40 GB.

The 1.28 GB per-query floor puts a hard bottom of $1.28 per million searches on
this workload however small the vectors get. **Whether recall survives any of
this is unevaluated — the figures above are money only.** Note the local vector
store already holds Q1.15 int16, so f16 is a format change rather than a new
loss of precision, while dimension reduction is not. This is Q14.

**Compared with the query embedding, turbopuffer is the larger cost at every
volume**, not just at scale: Fireworks costs $3–13 per million searches against
turbopuffer's $21.50 at f16. The two cross over only if the namespace shrinks below
about 13 GB, which at f16 it nearly has — so at the shipped dtype the two backends
cost within a factor of two of each other rather than one dominating.

**The BM25 degradation path this paragraph used to argue about no longer exists.**
D35 deleted it on 2026-08-14: every limit returns 429, and there is no fallback mode.
§6.5 and §11.1 both record the deletion and this subsection did not. What the
arithmetic *would* have shown, had the path survived, is that falling back to BM25
saves the smaller half of the bill and not most of it, because the turbopuffer query
is charged in full either way — which is one more reason the deletion was right.
BM25 remains a normal leg of the hybrid query (D29); what is gone is the fallback.

turbopuffer publishes **no spend cap and no budget alert**, so if a hard limit were
ever wanted this application would have to enforce it, metering itself on the
`billing` object every query response carries (`billable_logical_bytes_queried`,
`billable_logical_bytes_returned`). **None is wanted: D28 cancelled the spend cap and
no component enforces one.** What the `billing` object is for here is visibility —
§11.2 requires logging it so that a runaway is noticed, which is a different thing
from a limit.

Sources: turbopuffer's pricing page and pricing changelog, and the query,
warm-cache, pinning, regions and limits docs. The per-unit rates are not prose
on the pricing page — they live in the cost calculator's own constants — so
they are turbopuffer's numbers but not quotable at a finance department.

### 11.2 Cache warming, and why there is none (D27)

`GET /v1/namespaces/:ns/hint_cache_warm` looks free and is not. The warm-cache
doc: free "if turbopuffer is ready to serve requests with low latency, or it is
already getting the namespace ready" — otherwise "this request is billed as a
query that returns zero rows", and a zero-row query still pays the full
namespace charge, $0.0000115 here at f16 (§11.1b). The mechanism therefore costs a full
search exactly when it would have helped, and nothing when it would not. D27
drops it.

What is worth keeping from this section: **log `cache_temperature` and
`cache_hit_ratio` from every query response**, so a real regression is visible
rather than inferred, and log the `billing` object too. turbopuffer publishes no spend cap, and neither
does this application (D28) — the log is how a runaway becomes visible, not how it is
stopped (§11.1b).

**Whether the same counter also produces usage statistics is the user's to settle,
and it is owed.** He asked twice on 2026-08-13 — "我们可以用这个计数顺便做用户统计吗？",
then "…用户统计 & 使用量统计吗？" — and neither this plan nor the companion ever
answered. Two things a reader needs before it can be answered. First, it is nearly
free now and expensive later: layer 2 already writes a per-IP key on every search, so
a visitor count and a query count come out of the same write, whereas retrofitting them
means changing a key schema that is by then live. Second, **§11.1's own design is
against it**: layer 2 hashes the IP "with a rotating salt, never in the clear", which
is what makes the gate privacy-preserving and also destroys the cross-day identity a
distinct-visitor count would need. So the question is not "add a counter" but "which
of the two properties wins", and that is a decision about visitors' privacy, which
belongs to the user and not to this document. Until he takes it, the site ships with
no statistics of any kind and its owner cannot say how many people used it.

**And log every 429 with the layer that produced it** (edge rule, KV daily counter,
or the unbuilt global bucket). §11.1 defers layer 3 explicitly "from the Worker's own
telemetry, not from speculation", and that decision cannot be taken without knowing
how often layers 1 and 2 actually trip and against how many distinct clients. This is
the only telemetry any decision in this plan is waiting on.

### 11.3 Disclosure

The interpretations are LLM-generated. The site must say so plainly; readers
will otherwise treat them as authoritative documentation.

## 12. Repository layout and implementation order

### 12.1 Layout (D16)

**Amended 2026-08-24 — the site moved to its own repository (user-ordered).**
Everything site-side now lives in `contrib/isasearch-web` (the repository
this plan sits in): `src/site_export.py` and `src/site_source_pages.py`
(the `isabelle-semantics site-export` subcommand is retired; run
`python src/site_export.py` / `python src/site_source_pages.py`), the two
site test files under `tests/`, this plan and its companions under `docs/`,
`site/`, and the versioned pipeline state under `pipeline/` (the handover
file, the scan and map artefacts, the live-patch checkpoint). The generated
published tree is `published/` here, git-ignored. The DB library (`Isabelle_Semantic_Embedding`,
`contrib/Semantic_Embedding`) stays a dependency — the export imports it to
read the store. The "ship the export in the conda package" clause at this
section's end is retired with the subcommand.

**The Python tokenizer stayed behind in that package until 2026-08-26, and
that was a mistake this section recorded as a consequence.** It said D16's
one-repository argument now spanned two, that the §16.6 gate's CI "must see
both repositories — an operational point to settle when CI is wired". What
actually happened is that the gate's two halves each computed a path to the
other across the new boundary, both from their own `__file__`, and neither
could find it: **the Python half of the gate did not run at all between
2026-08-24 and 2026-08-26**, silently, because a gate that cannot start looks
exactly like a gate with nothing to report. It was found while writing
`docs/RELEASE.md`, not by anything that was watching.

`isabelle_tokenizer.py` and `tokenizer_asset.py` therefore live in
`site/tokenizer/` now, beside the port, the asset and the frozen inputs, with
the gate's workflow in this repository's `.github/`. Nothing in the DB package
imported them; the site is the tokenizer's only consumer. **D16 holds
unamended: one repository, one CI run** — which is the sentence the next
paragraph has always contained, and which the 2026-08-24 amendment should have
been read as violating rather than as qualifying. The paragraphs below predate the migration and
keep their original wording as the record of D16 as first ruled.

The site lives in this repository because the tokenizer has two
implementations that must not drift (§5.5); one repository and one CI run is
what enforces that, and version-number coordination across repositories would
not.

Built (the first three, 2026-08-19 and 2026-08-20) and still planned (the last two):

```
src/
  site_export.py          the site export (§8)                     BUILT
site/
  tokenizer/              BOTH implementations, the asset they read,
                          the frozen inputs and digest, and the two
                          drivers that check them (§5.5)            BUILT
  worker/                 Cloudflare Worker: search API, embedding cache, rate
                          limits, entity page rendering
  pages/                  static assets: subsetted IsabelleDejaVu, styles, scripts
```

**The Worker is built (2026-08-25) and lives at `worker/` at the repository
root**, not `site/worker/` — user-ruled with the migration's flat layout
(`src/`, `site/`, `pipeline/`, `worker/`), `site/` holding design and assets
rather than runtime code. `worker/README.md` describes it.

`test_site_export.py` sits beside `test_isabelle_tokenizer.py` at the repository
root, and needs neither the store, nor the Isabelle installation, nor the network.

**Three credentials, and none of them lives in this repository.** The export needs a
turbopuffer **write** key; the Worker needs a turbopuffer **read** key and the
Fireworks key. The user registered the turbopuffer account on 2026-08-09 and keeps
its development key in `~/Current/MLML/secret.sh`, which is outside the tree and
must stay outside it. The rules, which exist because this repository ships as a conda
package and `site/` is already a worry for that build (below):

- **No key in the repository, in any form** — not in `site/`, not in a `wrangler.toml`,
  not in a test fixture, not in a committed `.env`. The Worker's keys are set with
  `wrangler secret put` and exist only in Cloudflare; the export reads its key from the
  environment, sourced from `secret.sh` or the CI secret store.
- **The development key is not the production key.** turbopuffer issues scoped keys;
  the Worker gets a read-only one, so a leaked Worker key cannot rewrite the index,
  and the export's write key never reaches an edge runtime.
- **A key rotation invalidates nothing else** — the namespace name carries the data
  and asset digests (§8.2) and no credential, so keys can be rotated without an export.

Already in the repository, all of it cited as load-bearing elsewhere in this plan and
none of it listed here before 2026-08-19:

```
site/COPY.md              the authoritative source of every visitor-facing string
                          (§13b) — the mockup follows it, never the reverse.
                          The user delegated it on 2026-08-18: "COPY.md 你可以
                          自行修改，不需要我审批". The exception is the sentences
                          other decisions lock — D30 as amended and D40 — which
                          are quoted in this plan and change only with him.

                          the frozen bar, four lens reports and the rebuttal
```

**The plans this document cites live in three places since the 2026-08-24
migration**, and the citation convention here gives no path:
`BUG_UNIVERSAL_KEY_SHORT_NAME_FIX_PLAN.md` (D33) and
`THEORY_HASH_REKEY_PLAN.md` (D33's G1) at the MLML checkout root; the DB-side
plans — `ENTITY_POSITION_PLAN.md`, `THEORY_HASH_REGISTRY_PLAN.md`,
`DYNAMIC_MEMBER_NAMING_PLAN.md`, `VECTOR_INVALIDATION_PLAN.md`,
`SEMANTIC_DB_LAYERED_PLAN.md` — in `contrib/Semantic_Embedding`; and the
companion `SEMANTIC_SEARCH_SITE_PLAN_DONE.md` beside this file.

The export belongs to the Python package, not to `site/`: it reads LMDB, reuses
the Python tokenizer, and should ship in the conda package so that others can
export their own database.

Verified safe: `conda/recipe.yaml`'s build script installs an **explicit
allow-list** (`ROOT`, a few `.thy` files, `etc/`, `lib/`, `src/`, `Tools/`), so
`site/` cannot leak into the package. It is still copied into the build sandbox
by `source: path: ../`, so `node_modules/` and similar must be git-ignored.

### 12.2 Order, and what actually blocks what

Steps 1-5 are phase one and 6 is phase two (D32). Within phase one the order is
not a preference — three prerequisites feed the export, and none of them is
this plan's work.

**As of 2026-08-20 all three are done, and nothing outside this plan blocks the
export any more.** What remains is this plan's own work: writing the export (step 4)
and the interface (§9). Each prerequisite below keeps its full statement, because the
reason it was a prerequisite is what a reader needs when the export starts failing.

**Prerequisite A — the key repair (D33). DONE, 2026-08-18.**
`BUG_UNIVERSAL_KEY_SHORT_NAME_FIX_PLAN` rebuilt the store under corrected keys, and
`THEORY_HASH_REKEY_PLAN.md`'s migration ran with it, so a persistent theory's hash now
folds in its session-qualified long name. It had to run **first** because any export
taken before it would publish wrong theory data under document ids the rebuild then
changes, taking every permanent entity-page URL (D25) with them — that risk is now past.
Verified read-only on `cslh19`: `fsck` passes every invariant over 1,343,793 records,
including the XOR check the original defect used to pass silently; `orphans` reports 84
records against the defect's original 234,398. See D33 for what was not re-verified.

**Prerequisite B — the theory-hash registry**, per `THEORY_HASH_REGISTRY_PLAN.md`.
A name-addressed entity's declaring theory lives as a 16-byte hash in its key and
is unreadable without the table. Two things fail without it: the `Theory Name`
filter for the 199,044 name-addressed records (14.8 %), and **D24's scope test**,
which is exactly the declaring theory for those records — so the export cannot
even decide what to publish.

**DONE, 2026-08-20.** `THEORY_HASH_REGISTRY_PLAN.md` §9 was executed end to end:
`cslh19` migrated 10,594 persistent entries into `semantic_DB_dir()/theory_hash.lmdb`
(910 WIP refused, 0 sentinel conflicts, idempotent on a re-run), republished the
snapshot with the registry aboard, and this machine synced — its layered resolution
went from 183 of 10,561 to **10,561 of 10,561**, closing that plan's §7.1 window.
Verified here 2026-08-20: the registry holds 10,594 entries. The conda releases
(`isabelle-rpc` 0.5.0, `isabelle-semantic-embedding`) are deliberately unpublished and
are governed by that plan's release-order rule; they gate a *data* release, not this
export, which runs from the working tree.

**Prerequisite C — the published snapshot carries the entity positions. DONE.** One
artefact, and the diagram below used to label it differently from this paragraph. The
paragraph this replaces said the backfill was done on `cslh19` (80.2 %) while the
Hugging Face snapshot predated it, so this machine held 8,306, and that what remained
was the republish. The republish has happened twice since — 2026-08-19 after the
dynamic-member renaming migration, and 2026-08-20 with the theory-hash registry aboard
(`data/manifest.json`) — and this machine, which syncs from it, now carries a position
on **1,327,426 of its 1,343,793 records (98.8 %)**, measured 2026-08-20. So the
backfill also went well past the 80.2 % this document records; §9.4's "roughly one card
in five has no link" is now roughly one in eighty, and the defined behaviour for a card
with no link is still needed, just rarer.

```

1. ~~Repair U+007F (§10).~~ **Done** — zero of 1,362,343 records still carry
   U+007F, measured 2026-08-12.
2. Prerequisites A, B and C above. **A is done; B and C are outstanding and owned
   outside this plan.**
3. **Freeze the tokenizer**: Python implementation, JavaScript port, the shipped
   asset (D45, D46), the test-vector file with its synthetic cases, and the CI gate
   (§5.5, §16). **This never depended on A, B or C** — it needs the symbol table and
   the distribution, and although its test vectors are sampled from real entity
   expressions, the repair changed keys and not text. It remains the part of phase one
   that can proceed now, and it is where the work is.
4. Build the site export (§8) and load one full namespace. **The export is written
   and every gate before the upsert passes (§8.1); loading the namespace has not been
   done and needs the user's word.** It runs the Python tokenizer and emits the asset
   whose digest names the namespace (§8.2), which is why it came after step 3.

   **What stands between here and a first *production* namespace is now one thing,
   and it is not code: §8.2's open question about a name that does not move when the
   data does.**

   `THEORY_HASH_REKEY_REINTERPRET_LIST.md`, which §3.1 requires be read before the
   first export, is settled as far as this plan is concerned. Its Group 1 still owes
   **3 entity records** over three AFP theory pairs, so the first export publishes
   that gap — **the user accepted it on 2026-08-20: "可以接受".** Its Group 2's 13
   theories are every one of them outside D24's scope, and he ruled the same day that
   they need not be published — "这些不用发" — which changes nothing about whether
   they are restored to the database, a question that list owns and this plan does
   not.
5. Worker: search API, embedding cache, rate limits (§11.1). Blocked on 4.
6. Front end: search page, then entity pages. Phase two (D32).

The interface copy and the mockup are **done**, and this paragraph used to offer them
as available work: `site/COPY.md` reached draft 3 on 2026-08-14 after three rounds of
reader testing, `site/design/IsaSearch.dc.html` was brought in line with it, and both
are committed. Anything that reopens them is a change to `COPY.md` first (§13b). Note
also that the decision range is now **D21-D46**, not the D21-D41 this paragraph used
to name.

**Draft 3 correction.** Step 2 used to read "Build the complete hash-to-name
table (§7.3) - light, independent", meaning an Isabelle enumeration run. §7.3
now shows the table already exists and is already complete; what it needs is to
be *published*, which is a different job in a different plan.

## 13. Open questions

Q1, Q2 and Q4 of draft 1 are settled — see D19, D18 and D13 respectively.

- ~~Q3~~ — **settled, and the settlement has moved twice.** The rate limit is
  **D35's**: 5 requests per IP per 10 seconds at the Cloudflare edge, plus 1,000 per
  IP per UTC day in Workers KV, plus an unbuilt global bucket at 10,000/hour (§11.1).
  This entry said "12 requests per IP per minute", which was the answer before D35
  and is superseded. The daily *spend* cap is cancelled (D28), and D28 therefore
  contains no query-count figure — an earlier version of this entry attributed
  "~150,000" to it. Arithmetic retained purely as capacity information, since a
  per-IP limit does nothing against distributed abuse: Fireworks prices
  Qwen3-Embedding-8B at **$0.10 per million tokens** (its own tier; ≤150 M-parameter
  models are $0.008 and 150–350 M are $0.016), and a query costs 6 tokens when short.
  At D29's **8,000-character query cap** that is roughly 2,000 tokens, i.e. ~$0.0002 a
  search — the 512-character cap is D29's cap on a single *filter condition*, which
  is not what gets embedded, and an earlier version of this entry costed the query at
  it (~130 tokens). Whatever the figure, the arithmetic to do is not Fireworks alone:
  the query-embedding cache protects Fireworks only, every search hits turbopuffer
  whether or not the embedding was cached, and at f16 the two are within a factor of
  two of each other (§11.1b).
- ~~Q5~~ — **withdrawn, and it was never a real question.** It asked whether a
  second search field for whole-word matching was wanted, on the stated ground
  that "the syntactic filter is substring matching: searching `set` also hits
  `insert` and `setsum`". That ground was false in both draft-1 and draft-2
  designs. `insert` is a single token whose only subtoken is `insert`, so
  neither `expr_tokens` nor `expr_subtokens` ever matched `set` inside it —
  which is exactly what D6 says. Whole-word matching was not missing; it was
  the default. The real question hiding behind Q5 was how a condition should be
  routed between the two mechanisms, and D21 answers it by deleting one of them.
- ~~Q6~~ — settled: the concept is **the associated theories** (§1), and the
  notice required by D15 is drafted in §9.2b. The interface language it is
  finally written in is part of Q7.
- ~~Q7~~ — **settled by D30**: `isasearch`, English, and the design's own
  disclosure sentence.
- ~~Q8~~ — **settled by D26**: a theorem card shows no theory line at all
  unless a theory condition is active.
- ~~Q9~~ — **settled by D25**: they ship in the first release, and cards link
  to them.
- ~~Q10~~ — **settled by D24**: only entities living entirely inside AFP and
  the distribution; phi-system and the why3/NTP4VC material are both out.
- ~~Q14~~ — **settled by D31**: f16 at 4096 dimensions. One task falls out of
  it — measure the ranking change from Q1.15 int16 to f16 on real vectors
  before the export publishes.
- ~~Q11~~ — **settled by D29**, every part of it.
- ~~Q12~~ — **settled by D22**: the `Entity Name` panel reaches
  `name_subtokens`, so it stays in the export.
- ~~Q13~~ — **settled by D23**: the theory filter matches subtokens like the
  other two, and the field is `theory_subtokens`.

- ~~**Q13 (2026-08-25, user: 有必要重新导入)**~~ — **MOOT since 2026-08-26**:
  Q14's final ruling removed tokenization from search entirely (conditions are
  regular expressions over raw text), so there is no token condition for `_` or
  `.` to be matchable in. The re-export it wanted still happens, but for Q14's
  reasons (the `regex: true` flags, dropping the `*_subtokens` columns), with no
  tokenizer-rule change. Kept below as the record: **re-export with `_` and `.`
  kept as tokens instead of dropped** (`name_1` → `name` `_` `1`, so it no longer
  matches `name.1`, and `_ + _` finds nothing instead of every `+`), settling
  what the 90 rendered sub/superscript characters become at the same time; and
  use that run to test that the whole publish pipeline is stable and
  one-command. Needs: both tokenizer implementations, `tokenizer_rule` bump,
  asset + `expected.json` regenerated, COPY §0/§3.5/§5.1 rewritten and
  reader-tested, export to a new namespace, `TPUF_NAMESPACE` edit, deploy,
  old namespace deleted. Cost measured in cents (the $45 above was wrong).
  **Deferred by the user until after the front end ships.**

- **Q14 (2026-08-26, the user's rulings recorded inline)** — ~~**a standalone `_` in a
  condition means a wildcard matching ONE OR MORE subtokens**~~, so `f _ x` matches
  `f (a+b) x` and does not match `f x`. Rides Q13's re-export; not built.

  **SUPERSEDED the same day, by the user's final ruling: the `_` wildcard is
  replaced by letting the user write a raw regular expression.** His words:
  "直接取代 _ 通配符。Isasearch 的用户全是高级用户" — the site's users are all
  power users, so the friendly sugar is not worth a second pattern language.
  What this supersedes and what it keeps is itemised in "The design as it now
  stands" at the end of this entry; the paragraphs between here and there are
  kept as the record of the superseded design and of the measurements — the
  measurements all carry over, since the regex mode matches against exactly the
  same `\n`-joined column the wildcard would have.

  **Mechanism.** Three new string columns — `name_glob`, `expr_glob`, `theory_glob` —
  each holding that field's subtokens joined with `\n`, **with a leading and a trailing
  `\n` as well**; `{"type": "string", "glob": true}`. A condition compiles to a glob
  pattern: literal runs emit `\n` + escaped subtokens + `\n`, a wildcard emits `*`,
  and a leading/trailing `*` is added only when the pattern starts/ends with a literal.
  The boundary sentinels are load-bearing twice over — without them a condition on a
  record's first or last subtoken cannot be anchored, and "one or more" would degrade
  to "zero or more".

  **Why "one or more" falls out for free.** Adjacent subtokens share a single `\n`, so
  `\nf\n*\nx\n` cannot match `\nf\nx\n`: after consuming `\nf\n` only `x\n`
  remains and the suffix needs three characters. No subtoken is empty and none contains
  whitespace (measured: 0 of 407,574), which is the invariant this rests on.

  **The user's rulings, 2026-08-26.** All three panels support it, not just Expression
  (so the `All` panel can still OR the three). Metacharacters are handled by **plain
  escaping**, not by transliterating them out of the alphabet — "老老实实转义". And
  **the wildcard does not respect term structure**: it skips subtokens, not balanced
  subterms, and the user judged the structure-aware alternative too costly for too
  little ("代价太大，而且能实现的很有限"). That last ruling is what keeps the whole
  design server-side, since respecting structure was the only thing a Worker-side
  post-filter could do that a filter cannot — and §6.6 forbids post-filtering.

  **Escaping is safe here because `\` before ANY character is accepted** and means the
  literal character (measured 2026-08-26 against the live account, for
  `* ? [ ] { } ! ^ - \` and for ordinary letters). So the rule is a whitelist — escape
  every character outside `[A-Za-z0-9]` — and needs no enumeration of the
  metacharacter set, which is what keeps it from rotting when the dialect changes.
  Order matters: tokenize first, escape each subtoken, then build the pattern by
  concatenation; the `\n` and `*` we insert are never escaped. An unescaped `[` is an
  **HTTP 400**, not a zero-result (measured), and glob metacharacters appear in 15.67 %
  of documents, so this is a hot path. `?` is not among them at the subtoken level: D4
  strips it before subtokens are formed (measured, 0 occurrences).

  **Measured cost — and the first reading of it was wrong.** A 2026-08-26 measurement
  on namespaces of 100,000 and 400,000 records concluded that glob "is the same order
  as `ContainsTokenSequence` and sometimes cheaper", and that a pathological `*a*`
  being the fastest of eight queries "rules out a linear scan". **It does not.** Those
  figures were all taken on the **ANN leg** — `rank_by ["vector","ANN",v]` with
  `top_k` — where no mechanism exceeded 49 ms at any size and the filter type is very
  nearly invisible. Isolating the filter with `aggregate_by {"n":["Count","id"]}`, which
  evaluates it against every row, shows `Glob` and `Regex` scaling **linearly in row
  count** — they are scans — while `ContainsTokenSequence` stays flat on a single
  literal. At 1,200,000 rows the weak literal `+` costs 9 ms under
  `ContainsTokenSequence`, **1,977 ms under `Glob` and 1,198 ms under `Regex`**, and
  ~88 ms under either when conjoined with the literal runs. Extrapolated to
  production's 1,337,009: `Glob` alone ~2.2 s, `Regex` alone ~1.3 s, narrowed ~98 ms.
  A rare anchor is free at any size (an unmatched pattern is 10 ms over 1.2M rows —
  Rust's literal prefilter), so it is the *common* literal that hurts.

  Two lessons worth keeping: a filter-only query with `rank_by ["id","asc"]` early-exits
  at `top_k` and understates weak-literal cost by an order of magnitude, so
  `aggregate_by` is the only clean exhaustive metric; and `Regex` is **1.4–1.7× cheaper
  than `Glob` on the conditions where the filter costs anything at all** — measured at
  all three sizes on the five weak-literal conditions (`x + y` through `_ + _`). On a
  selective condition both sit at 10–12 ms and the ratio is 1.0, because a rare anchor
  lets each engine's literal prefilter discard nearly everything: an unmatched pattern
  is 10 ms over 1.2M rows. So "Regex is cheaper" is true where it matters and empty
  where it does not, and it inverts this section's earlier framing of glob as the safe
  option without being the reason to choose Regex.

  **The reason to choose `Regex` is the escaping, not the speed.** On the leg the site
  actually sends — vector ANN with `top_k` — nothing exceeded 49 ms for any mechanism at
  any size, against an end-to-end search of 1000–1700 ms, so this cost difference is
  invisible to a visitor. What is not invisible is that globset has **no JavaScript
  library**, and its intuitive escape is wrong (`[!]` and `[^]` are HTTP 400), whereas
  `escape-string-regexp` is verified against the live service. One column declared `{"type":"string","glob":true,"regex":true}` is
  accepted and serves both, so the export need not choose a dialect. Storage: the three columns are ~280 MB against a namespace whose
  11.0 GB of 11.5 GB is vectors — **2.4 %**, so the binding constraint is not bytes but
  §8.2, which makes a column omitted now cost a full re-export to add.

  **Bracket matching: asked for, measured, then dropped (2026-08-26).** The user asked
  whether the skipped run could be required to have balanced brackets, so that
  `f _ x` would reject `f (a x`. **Arbitrary depth is impossible**: turbopuffer's regex
  is Rust's `regex` crate (identified from its own errors — *"backreferences are not
  supported"*, *"look-around ... is not supported"*, `(?P<n>…)` accepted), a finite
  automaton engine, and every recursion extension was rejected in a live test — PCRE
  `(?R)`, `(?1)`, `(?&p)`, Oniguruma `\g<0>`, .NET balancing groups. Nesting is not a
  regular language; no engine of this class can do it. **Bounded depth works and was
  demonstrated**: at depth ≤2 the pattern
  `\nf\n(?:[^\n()]+\n|\(\n(?:[^\n()]+\n|\(\n(?:[^\n()]+\n)*\)\n)*\)\n)+x\n`
  correctly accepted every balanced case to depth 2 and rejected `f (a x`, `f a) x` and
  `f (((a))) x` — the last silently, which is the cost of a bound. **The user then ruled
  against building it**, so the wildcard stays structure-blind. Recorded because the
  measurement is what makes "arbitrary depth" a closed question rather than an
  open one.

  **What decides `Regex` against `Glob`.** With bracket matching dropped the two express
  the same thing (`\nf\n(?:[^\n]+\n)+x\n` against `*\nf\n?*\nx\n*`), so the choice
  is one trade-off. `Glob` has measured cost and **no JavaScript library for its dialect**
  (globset): the intuitive uniform escape `[c]` is wrong — `[!]` and `[^]` are HTTP 400,
  because `!`/`^` lead a negated class — so it needs either hand-written escaping or the
  symmetric-encoding scheme, whose table must be identical in Python and JavaScript.
  `Regex` has **no measured cost** and turbopuffer's explicit warning, but its escaping is
  a solved problem: `escape-string-regexp`'s output was verified against the live service
  on all 55 metacharacter-bearing subtokens in the sampled corpus, and all 14,922 distinct
  subtokens escape to valid patterns (a 96,275-character alternation was accepted). The
  narrowing that the warning itself sanctions is free here, because a wildcard pattern's
  literal runs are **logically implied by** the regex and so cannot change the result set.

  **The row loss, root-caused (2026-08-26, follow-up session).** The first write-up of
  this failure asserted an invented cause; a dedicated investigation then found the real
  one. The failure as first measured: bare `Glob` and bare `Regex` **silently return far
  fewer rows than `top_k`** — at 1.2M rows the condition `x + y` (2,831 true matches)
  returned 41 of 200 while `ContainsTokenSequence` returned a full 200; the count varied
  with the query vector (62–200) and, it later turned out, with the index build (a
  byte-identical rebuild of the same 1.2M rows returned 74 where the first build
  returned 41). The mechanism, established by measurement:

  turbopuffer evaluates a `Glob`/`Regex` filter under an ANN query on one of **two
  paths**, chosen per pattern. Call them the **indexed path** — the pattern index
  (changelog 2026-02: "Regex index") pre-locates the matching rows, the ANN search is
  directed to them, and recall is exact — and the **neighborhood path** — the ANN
  search explores a bounded region around the query vector and the pattern is applied
  to that region only, so the query returns **only the true matches that happen to lie
  inside the explored region**. Everything observed follows from this: the loss varies
  with the query vector (a different vector explores a different region), grows with
  `top_k` but never reaches the true count (a larger `top_k` widens the region), skips
  matches in contiguous rank bands (whole clusters lie outside the region — measured:
  the rows kept from the full-recall ranking were 74 scattered over ranks 0–1888, with
  the rank-1 match among the skipped), and differs between index builds of identical
  data (clustering is randomized). Five independent signatures separate the two paths,
  all measured on the 1.2M probe namespace: filter-only scan cost (indexed 12–77 ms,
  neighborhood-path patterns 129–385 ms — near-full scans), ANN latency (13–35 ms vs a
  tight 38–42 ms band), saturation (indexed-path conditions return exactly
  `min(true, top_k)` at every `top_k`; neighborhood-path conditions plateau below it,
  e.g. `a = b` with 2,608 true matches returned 1,081 at `top_k` 3200), query-vector
  dependence (neighborhood path only), and the contiguous-band skip shape. Which path a
  pattern gets **correlates with the row frequency of its most common required token**:
  every measured condition whose tokens all stay under ~7 % of rows (`n + 1`, `i < n`,
  `xs ys`, `finite _ set`, `poincare _ mapsto`, …) rode the indexed path with exact
  recall at every `top_k` and every vector; every condition containing a token above
  ~23 % (`x` at 278k rows, `=` at 587k of 1.2M) rode the neighborhood path (`x + y`,
  `x * y`, `x - y`, `a = b`, `f x = x`). The exact rule is turbopuffer-internal — the
  boundary between 7 % and 23 % was not located, and attempts to defeat the index with
  semantically identical rewrites (character classes, `{1,2}` repetitions, duplicate
  alternations) never dislodged a pattern from the indexed path, so the index is
  automaton-based rather than naive-literal-extraction. Selectivity of the whole
  condition is irrelevant — `poincare _ mapsto` at 0.005 % (61 matches) returned all 61
  everywhere, fifty times more selective than the failing `x + y`.

  **The documentation contradiction is resolved — the docs were right and the earlier
  reading was wrong.** The `Regex` warning ("Currently requires exhaustive evaluation;
  not recommended for large namespaces or ANN queries **unless used in conjunction with
  other selective filters**") describes precisely the neighborhood path and prescribes
  precisely the repair below. `Glob` carries no such warning but shares the machinery —
  in every measurement bare `Glob` and bare `Regex` returned identical row sets. And
  the `ContainsTokenSequence` warning ("a partial postfilter which may lead to reduced
  recall on ANN queries") is **also real**: the earlier "no loss anywhere" measurement
  had simply never tried a condition made of ubiquitous tokens (see next paragraph).

  **The repair reduces the loss but does not eliminate it.** Conjoining the pattern's
  literal runs — `And([ContainsTokenSequence(run₁), …, Regex(pattern)])` — cannot
  change the answer (the runs are logically implied by the pattern) and restored full
  recall in most measured cases, including the cross-field `Or` shape of the `All`
  panel and every wildcard condition with a sub-7 % token. But on conditions built
  entirely from ubiquitous tokens the conjoined form still loses, because
  `ContainsTokenSequence` is itself a partial postfilter on the same lossy machinery:
  measured on the probe namespace, repaired `x - y` returned 134 of 200 at `top_k` 200
  and repaired `a = b` returned 2,319 of 2,608 at `top_k` 3200.

  **The bigger discovery: production loses rows today, without any wildcard.** The live
  namespace's only condition mechanism is bare `ContainsTokenSequence`, and on
  conditions dominated by the corpus's most frequent token — `=`, which equality puts
  in essentially every theorem — it collapses. Measured on the live 1,337,009-row
  namespace with real 4096-dim vectors (read-only): `f x = x` has **142** true matches
  and returned **2, 1, 6, 0** rows across four query vectors at `top_k` 200 (2 at
  `top_k` 3200); `a = b` has 2,928 and returned 47–106, saturating at 106; `x = y` has
  14,880 and returned 438 at `top_k` 3200. Meanwhile `x + y`, `x * y`, `x - y` were
  exact on production at every `top_k` — the frequency profile of *this* corpus decides
  which conditions break, so the probe namespace (where `x + y` fails) and production
  (where `f x = x` fails) disagree about individual conditions while obeying the same
  rule. The earlier all-clear on production tested seven conditions that all happened
  to sit on the indexed path. **This is a standing correctness defect of the live
  search, independent of Q14, with no known in-engine mitigation** — raising `top_k`
  saturates below the true count, and a condition of all-common tokens offers no
  selective conjunct to add. What to do about it (report to turbopuffer with the
  reproduction, mitigate, or accept and document) is the user's call, not settled here.

  **The solution (2026-08-26, same session, measured end to end): turbopuffer's
  documented exact mode, `rank_by: ["vector", "kNN", …]`.** Announced in their
  changelog December 2024 as "kNN exact search for 100% recall on filtered vector
  search queries"; the docs state it "performs an exhaustive search, computing the
  exact distance from the query vector to every document matching the filters", and
  that it *requires* filters (which every conditioned query has). It replaces the
  neighborhood path entirely — no conjunction repair, no chunking, no reliance on
  undocumented behavior. Verified:

  - **Probe namespace (1.2M rows), bare `Regex`/`Glob`/`ContainsTokenSequence` under
    kNN**: complete on every condition including every previously failing one, and the
    returned ranking matched a locally computed exact cosine ranking **position by
    position**, the only deviations being swaps and one boundary substitution among
    rows whose distances differ by ≤ 8.6×10⁻⁵ — f16 rounding ties, deterministic
    across calls.
  - **Production (1,337,009 rows, real 4096-dim vectors, read-only), bare
    `ContainsTokenSequence` under kNN**: every adversarial condition complete where
    ANN had collapsed — `f x = x` 142/142 (ANN: 2), `a = b` full 200 (ANN: 47–106),
    `x = y` full (ANN: 190–200), and even a bare `=` with 655,804 matches complete.
    The `f x = x` ranking was verified against local exact ground truth: **zero
    order differences**. This also empirically answers the one caveat the docs left
    open — kNN is exact even when the filter is a partial-postfilter operator.
  - **Cross-field `Or` (the `All` panel shape) under kNN**: complete on every
    condition tried.

  **The price is latency, and it is the latency of exactness**: filter evaluation
  plus exhaustive scoring of the matches. Measured on production: 86 ms
  (`finite set`) – 174 ms (`x - y`) – 223 ms (`x + y`) – 554 ms (`f x = x`, whose
  filter scan is the expensive part) – 1.2 s (`x = y`, 14,880 matches) – 5–8 s for
  the degenerate bare `=` (655,804 matches, half the corpus). Billing is negligible:
  queries bill by data scanned with a 1.28 GB per-query minimum at $1/PB ≈
  $0.0000013 per query. ~~Design decisions this leaves to the user: whether every
  conditioned query simply uses kNN (recommended — unconditioned queries keep ANN,
  which kNN cannot serve anyway since it requires filters), and whether
  near-degenerate conditions get a match-count bound for the latency tail.~~
  **Ruled 2026-08-26**: the user judged the 5–8 s degenerate tail unacceptable and
  approved routing by exact match count — Count first, then kNN at or below a
  threshold, ANN above it. The design is §6.3c; the threshold value is still his
  to pick.
  With kNN, the conjunction repair is no longer needed for correctness; conjoining
  the literal runs remains available as a filter-scan optimization only.

  **Fallback, archived**: if kNN were ever lost, a chunked scheme over
  `["id","In",…]` lists of ≤ ~250 ids (exhaustive-and-exact below a measured
  ~300-entry boundary; complete, zero-retry, order-exact pipelines measured at 0.2–
  10.6 s) works, with per-chunk completeness verifiable client-side because the
  expected row count is known; and a bigram (adjacent-subtoken-pair) column would
  shrink the lossy-path surface by ~3 orders of magnitude (155 of 833,380 pairs
  above 1 % of rows vs 174 of 54,406 singletons) without eliminating it. Both are
  documented in the agents' reports under `~/isasearch-pipeline/regexprobe/`.

  **Also observed while measuring**: the cold-first-vector-query phenomenon
  reproduced twice more on production — 9.13 s on an ANN query after an idle gap
  (fourth observation) and one kNN query that exceeded a 300 s client timeout after
  a ~4-minute idle gap yet ran at 542 ms on retry. ~~Worth including in any
  turbopuffer conversation (a draft engineering report sits at
  `~/isasearch-pipeline/regexprobe/agentC/turbopuffer-report-draft.md`, not sent).
  The probe namespace `isasearch-regexprobe-64d-1200k` is deliberately left alive
  as the reproduction substrate — delete it once the turbopuffer conversation is
  settled (a rebuild costs ~12 minutes via `build.py`).~~ **Ruled 2026-08-26: the
  report is not sent** ("不发"); the probe namespace was deleted the same day
  (rebuild recipe: `~/isasearch-pipeline/regexprobe/build.py`, ~12 minutes).

  **The 4 KiB filterable-value limit does not apply** (measured 2026-08-26, closing this
  question): a `{"type":"string","glob":true,"regex":true}` column accepted a
  **62,891-byte** value, stored it whole and matched patterns anchored at its head,
  middle and tail. Namespace metadata reports such a column as `filterable: false`,
  the same "different storage path" signature `pre_tokenized_array` shows. The corpus
  maximum of 6,427 subtokens is ~35 KB, comfortably inside.

  **Two spellings that are silently wrong.** In turbopuffer's regex **`.` does not cross
  `\n`** — `\nf\n.*\nx\n` matches nothing at all — so the gap must be spelled
  `(?:[^\n]+\n)+` or `(?s:.)*`; both were measured identical in count and cost. And
  `Regex` is a substring search, not a full match, so it needs no outer anchor, unlike
  `Glob`, which does need its leading and trailing `*`.

  ~~**Still open**: whether Q13 rides with it; the lexing rule for `_` (whitespace-
  delimited only, or any separator); what a condition consisting only of wildcards
  does (today a bare `_` is `condition_empty`; as a wildcard it would mean "match
  everything", which D7 forbids, so it must still be rejected with different copy);
  whether the 4 KiB filterable-value limit applies to a `glob` column (order 10²–10³
  rows would exceed it); and that `coll(_)`, which §5.1 rules matches nothing on
  purpose, would start matching `coll(<anything>)`.~~ The `_`-specific opens
  (lexing rule, wildcard-only condition, `coll(_)`) died with the wildcard; the
  4 KiB question was closed above (does not apply); whether Q13 rides with the
  same re-export remains open.

  **The design as it now stands (2026-08-26, the user's final rulings).** A
  condition is one of exactly two forms: a **token-sequence condition** — the
  text is tokenized and compiled to `ContainsTokenSequence`, exactly as today —
  or a **regex condition**, in which the user writes a raw regular expression
  and it is sent, verbatim, as a `Regex` filter over that field's `\n`-joined
  subtoken column (leading and trailing `\n` sentinels, as specified above).
  There is no `_` wildcard, no server-side pattern synthesis, and therefore
  **no escaping pipeline at all** — the `escape-string-regexp` verification
  above is recorded work that nothing now uses. What makes the raw-regex form
  viable is the pair of facts this entry established: under the count router
  (§6.3c) a bare `Regex` filter is **exact** — no conjunction repair, whose
  extraction from an arbitrary user pattern would be impossible anyway — and
  the engine is Rust `regex`, whose **linear-time guarantee means no user
  pattern can be a denial-of-service** (no backtracking blowup exists in that
  engine; cost is bounded by the scan the count round pays regardless, measured
  10–385 ms per pattern at 1.2M rows).

  What the reader must be told shrank to one hover line, by the user's ruling
  of 2026-08-26 ("大家都知道是怎么做的"): COPY.md §3.2's regex switch hover
  carries the one non-inferable fact (the pattern is matched against the
  entity's parts joined by newlines — COPY's vocabulary says **part**, never
  token), §5.8 relays the engine's own error verbatim, and the about page
  teaches nothing (its matching section was deleted the same day). For the
  implementer's reference only: patterns match a **substring of the token
  stream**
  — the field's subtokens joined by `\n` with a `\n` at each end — so a literal
  token is spelled `\nfoo\n`, "skip one or more tokens" is spelled
  `(?:[^\n]+\n)+` (`.` does not cross `\n`; `(?s:.)*` is the zero-or-more gap),
  and regex metacharacters that are ordinary Isabelle syntax (`+ * ( ) [ ]`)
  must be escaped by the user — the burden of escaping moves to the reader,
  which the user accepted knowingly: the site's users are all power users.

  **Dialect checking.** The only authority on the dialect is turbopuffer's own
  parser (Rust `regex`: no look-around, no backreferences — its error strings
  are legible and were how the engine was identified). Two-layer validation:
  client-side live checking with a Rust-`regex`-compiled-to-WASM checker if a
  sound package exists (verify during implementation, do not assume), and, as
  the authoritative backstop, the Worker's own count round — a malformed
  pattern makes the `aggregate_by` count query fail with the parser's message,
  which the interface surfaces. The backstop costs nothing extra: the count
  round runs anyway.

  **Schema consequence.** The three new columns are
  `{"type": "string", "regex": true}` — the `glob` flag is dropped; nothing
  uses it (the Regex-over-Glob choice above is thereby final, now on the
  stronger ground that Glob has no user-facing form at all).

  **Routing.** A regex condition is a condition like any other: the count
  round evaluates it exactly, the 3 % line and the fallback of §6.3c apply
  unchanged. A pattern that matches everything is just a maximally dense
  condition — it routes to the ANN branch and is not an error (D7's rejection
  of the *empty* condition text is unchanged and happens before any request).

  **Measurements recorded for the router (2026-08-26, production, read-only;
  all overlap figures are ANN's top 200 against kNN's exact top 200, three
  query vectors per condition of which one — a long equation — is the
  adversarial direction for `=`-shaped conditions):** the fourteen dense
  conditions first cited in §6.3c were thirteen single tokens plus the pair
  `⇒ bool`, all positive `ContainsTokenSequence` forms, counts 61k–857k (the
  857k is `(`), measured with ONE query vector — recorded here so the easy
  direction is not mistaken for a sample. Today's adversarial sweep: dirty
  below the line — `x = y` 1.11 % overlap 32–140 with one under-fill (66 rows,
  caught by the fallback), `= x` 1.40 % down to 148, `a =` 1.68 % down to 102,
  `= y` 2.43 % down to 108 — and clean in the 2.4–4.1 % window (`⟶` 2.42 %,
  `if` 2.57 %, `¬` 3.72 %, `( x` 3.82 %, `1` 3.95 %, `-` 4.06 %, `*` 4.10 %:
  192–200/200 on every vector). Above the line the residual approximation
  measures 169–200/200 (worst `( '` at 6.74 % → 169; `) =` 18.65 % → 188;
  `x =` 6.24 % → 187). Negation is the shape density cannot protect:
  `Not(=)` at 50.95 % overlapped 155/200 on the adversarial vector (195/200
  elsewhere); `Not(()` at 35.88 % → 191–195. The `All`-panel three-field `Or`
  behaved like its density class (dirty at 1.11 %, clean at 7.06 %), and
  clustered theory conditions were exact everywhere tried (they are small, so
  they route to kNN regardless). Raw output in the session transcript of
  2026-08-26; scripts under `~/isasearch-pipeline/regexprobe/`.

  **The user's final rulings, verbatim intent:** the line is **3 % of the
  namespace's row count** (a fraction, so each release re-derives it by
  construction — every measured dirty full-200 point lies below it and goes to
  kNN; the 2.4–4.1 % window above it measured clean); negation-shaped and
  other above-the-line conditions are **served from ANN and tagged
  approximate** — not forced through a 5–6 s kNN, not refused — with the
  measured 169–200/200 recorded as what "approximate" means there, and the
  under-fill fallback catching the rest; and the raw-regex replacement of the
  wildcard, recorded above.

  **THE FINAL RULING (2026-08-26, third revision, supersedes "The design as it
  now stands" above): conditions are regular expressions over RAW TEXT, and the
  site stops tokenizing altogether.** The user's words: "既然有了正则，我们就
  不需要再做 token 序列化了，也不需要 token parser 了", following his earlier
  "regex 不是专家功能而是默认功能". What this means, precisely:

  - **A condition is a regular expression. There is no other condition form, no
    switch, no token-sequence mode.** The condition box's placeholder reads
    "a regular expression" (user-ruled).
  - **The pattern is matched against the field's raw text as the site displays
    it** — `expr` is stored untruncated through `clean_for_display` (CRLF
    normalisation only), so "what you see is what you grep" holds by
    construction. Whole-word matching is the dialect's own `\b` (measured 2026-08-26:
    `\<`…`\>` also works, so the engine is regex ≥ 1.9); `_` is a word
    character, so `\bsorted\b` does not match inside `sorted_wrt` (measured).
  - **Schema: no new columns.** The existing raw `name`, `expr` and `theory`
    string attributes gain `regex: true` at the re-export. The earlier
    `name_regex`/`expr_regex`/`theory_regex` naming ruling is moot. The
    `name_subtokens`/`expr_subtokens`/`theory_subtokens` FTS columns lose their
    only consumer and are dropped at the same re-export.
  - **Everything the `\n`-joined design needed dies with it**: the joined
    columns, the sentinels, the `(?:[^\n]+\n)+` idiom, the "`.` does not cross
    `\n`" teaching — though the FACT survives on raw text too (measured: `.`
    does not cross a real newline; `(?s)`, `[\s\S]` and plain `\s` do) — and
    the whole-part anchoring story.
  - **Q13 is moot** (see the banner on its entry): its purpose was to make `_`
    and `.` matchable inside token conditions; in raw text they are characters.
    With it die the tokenizer-rule bump, the asset regeneration, and the
    two-edit hazard the 2026-08-26 review flagged as its top blocker.
  - **The site's tokenizer subsystem retires**: `site/tokenizer/`, the §16.6
    two-implementation digest gate, and the ML-side twin exist only for the
    `*_subtokens` columns, which are being dropped. Retirement is an
    implementation-phase change (code deletions ride the re-export release, not
    this document).
  - **Abbreviation expansion retires from condition boxes** (user-ruled: "完全
    放弃缩写"); `\<symbol>` ASCII forms are translated to their symbols before
    sending (table-driven on known symbol names, deterministic), and NFC is
    applied — "verbatim" means "verbatim after NFC and symbol-form translation".
  - **Unchanged**: the count router (§6.3c) — a regex condition routes by exact
    match count like anything else; `excludes` compiles to `Not(Regex)` (probe
    pending); the empty condition text is rejected before any request (D7); the
    `on:'all'` combination stays rejected while the All panel is absent from
    the interface; the M3 measurement (dense-regex overlap under ANN) is now a
    LAUNCH GATE, since regex is the only condition form.

  **The dialect probe ran the same day, all green** (script:
  `~/isasearch-pipeline/regexprobe/rawprobe/probe.py`; 22 measurements on a
  throwaway namespace, deleted after): `Not(Regex)` exact and composable;
  `\b`/`\<`…`\>` whole-word semantics identical, `_` a word character; `.`
  stops at a real newline while `(?s)`, `[\s\S]` and `\s` cross it and `(?m)`
  anchors work; empty pattern, lone `^` and lone `$` all match everything;
  `(?i)`, `\x{27F9}`, `\p{L}` and POSIX classes all supported. One recorded
  footgun: in `\<name>` a trailing bare `>` is a LITERAL `>` (only `\>` is the
  word-end assertion), so an untranslated `\<name>` silently matches nothing —
  harmless for known symbol names, which are translated before sending.
  **What must still precede the release: the M3 overlap sweep re-run with
  raw-text patterns — now a launch gate.**

## 13b. Reader testing of the interface copy — done

Three rounds, drafts 1 through 3, moved to `SEMANTIC_SEARCH_SITE_PLAN_DONE.md` §13b, where
the citations elsewhere in this document resolve. What
each round changed, and what was rejected and why, is in `site/COPY.md` §12; that is the
list not to re-raise. `site/COPY.md` is the authoritative source of every visitor-facing
string, and `site/design/IsaSearch.dc.html` follows it, never the reverse.

## 14. Considered and rejected

Do not re-raise these without new evidence.

### 14.1 Cloudflare Vectorize
Maximum 1536 dimensions against our 4096; eight comparison operators with a
64-byte indexed prefix and no substring matching; and, decisively, **no vector
ID allow-list**, so a mask computed elsewhere cannot be handed to it. Filtering
is a genuine pre-filter, which does not help when the filter is inexpressible.

### 14.2 First-order pattern matching
Matching a user-written pattern requires parsing it, which requires Isabelle's
parser and a theory context (notation is theory-local). That means a resident
Isabelle process in the query path — the single heaviest operational burden in
any design considered. Dropping it is what makes the site serverless. The
record codec is positional tail-append, so `term_skel` / `type_skel` fields can
be added later without redesign.

### 14.3 Self-hosting on the VPS
Measured on `sg.qiyuan.me`: 2 vCPU that are **two hyperthreads of one physical
core** — two-thread aggregate memory bandwidth 12.44 GB/s against 12.28 GB/s for
one thread, i.e. **no scaling**. Kernels: sequential read 29.6 GB/s,
XOR+popcount 8.55 GB/s (no AVX512_VPOPCNTDQ), Q1.15 dot product 11.55 GB/s.
Disk is network-attached EBS: 131 MB/s sequential, **7.3 MB/s random 4 K
(≈1,870 IOPS)**.

Consequences: a full-precision scan of 11.1 GB takes **85 s** from disk, 0.96 s
if resident — and 3.7 GB of RAM cannot hold it. Upgrading to 8 GB does not help
(11.1 GB still does not fit); 16 GB would, at 0.96 s per query, still too slow
to be interactive. A compressed two-stage design would work (binary coarse pass
693 MB at 81 ms), but requires operating a server. It also has one genuine
advantage turbopuffer lacks — a locally measured 47–85 ms full-corpus substring
scan over a 163 MB blob, which supports arbitrary mid-identifier substrings
(D6). Rejected on operational cost.

### 14.4 Qdrant Cloud
Native `HasIdCondition` is the cleanest allow-list of any service examined, but
it has no arbitrary substring filter (`MatchText` is tokenised full-text), so a
mask would have to be computed outside and shipped in. Third-party figures put
a suitable cluster at $120–200/month against turbopuffer's $16 minimum;
turbopuffer's own `Glob`/`Regex` and `["id","In",…]` cover both needs anyway.

### 14.5 Encoding token boundaries into a string
An earlier design normalised to a string with a private-use-area sentinel at
every token boundary, to be matched with `Glob`. The adversarial review found
it fatal: anchoring the query at both ends broke every partial-identifier
query.

**Partly superseded 2026-08-26 by Q14**, which proposes a glob column for *wildcard
conditions only* rather than as the mechanism for all conditions. The fatal objection
does not transfer: Q14's pattern is unanchored (leading and trailing `*`) while the
boundary sentinels live in the stored value, so partial-identifier queries work —
measured. The size figure does not transfer either: measured at **+41 %** over the
subtoken bytes, not 187 %, and 2.4 % of the namespace. The metacharacter objection
**does** transfer and is answered by escaping, not dissolved; the 4 KiB objection
stands unmeasured and is Q14's first probe. It also cost 187 % of the original size in UTF-8, brushed the 4 KiB
filterable limit, and inherited `globset`'s metacharacter problems — `?` alone
is 6.2 % of all characters in the corpus, and an unclosed `[` or `{` makes the
whole query **error** rather than return nothing. Token arrays dissolve all of
it: boundaries are structural, and no character is special.

### 14.6 Keeping two expression mechanisms, and collapsing to the wrong one

Two alternatives were weighed against D21 on 2026-08-12.

**Keeping both mechanisms and routing between them.** Draft 2 did this without
ever deciding the routing rule. Three routings were put to the user on
2026-08-09 — a per-condition exact/loose toggle, the union of both, and "exact
by default, fall back to word matching when the whole query returns nothing" —
and none was answered before the front end was deferred. Each has a defect. The
toggle makes every user learn a distinction before they can use the control.
The union reintroduces the noise the subtoken level was supposed to be
quarantined from: `f x` becomes `f` and `x` anywhere, and those are the two
commonest variable names in the corpus. The fallback has a structural blind
spot — it fires only on zero results, so a query that happens to score three
exact hits never reaches the several hundred word-level hits the user wanted.
D21 removes the question rather than answering it.

**Collapsing to `ContainsAllTokens` instead.** This was the user's first
proposal and the literal meaning of "replace". Rejected on two measured
grounds. First, the old subtoken rule discards every fragment with no
alphanumeric character, so every operator and bracket vanishes from the index:
`⟹` (42 % of documents), `=` (50 %), `⟦`/`⟧` (25 %) and `::` (9.89 %) would all
become unfilterable — those four are over §3.3's 230,944-document namespace, which is
where the D21 experiments were run, and an `excludes` on any of them would reduce to the empty
list. Two of the three example conditions written into the design brief
(`-->`, `⟦?P; ?Q⟧`) could not be expressed at all. Second, `ContainsAllTokens`
is unordered and non-adjacent, which is not a looser syntactic filter but a
different thing: `f x` would match any expression containing an `f` and an `x`
anywhere, i.e. very nearly the whole corpus. Adjacency is what makes the filter
syntactic. Keeping `ContainsTokenSequence` and narrowing the discard rule
instead retains both properties at the cost of a rule that names its separators
explicitly.

**"Adjacency is what makes the filter syntactic" was overridden by the user on
2026-08-26**, for wildcard conditions only (Q14). He was shown this paragraph and
ruled anyway. What is given up is exactly what it says: `f _ x` skips an unbounded run
and will match across `⟹`, `=` and brackets, so a wildcard condition is a weaker
filter than an adjacent one — very nearly the corpus when both runs are common. What
is kept is that this applies **only** where the reader typed a `_`; every condition
without one still compiles to `ContainsTokenSequence` and still means adjacency. The
paragraph above stands as the reason not to make this the default, which nobody
proposes.

Note a defect the narrowed rule also fixes. With operators discarded, `f x + y`
has subtokens `['f','x','y']`, so an adjacency query for `x y` would match
across a `+` that sits between them in the real expression. Keeping the
operator makes `['f','x','+','y']` and the false match disappears.

### 14.7 Making `'` a separator, so a type variable stops splitting

Raised 2026-08-18, rejected the same day. Under §5.2 a quasi-letter may continue an
identifier but not begin one, so Isabelle's type variable `'a` is two tokens and
the bare `'` survives into the subtoken array — measured, **179,860 expressions
(13.20 %)** carry one, **169,005** of them in the array interior, where under
`ContainsTokenSequence` it breaks any run passing through it. That is three and a
half times commoner than the fallback-kept-token case (**3.81 %** over the whole
corpus, §5.4 — this said 3.71 %, which matches no denominator) that the 2026-08-14
review raised and its rebuttal round deleted, and no reviewer raised this one at
all.

The proposal was to put `'` in §5.4's separator class, so that `'a` and `a` index
alike. It was rejected on the argument that **the query it would fix is not a legal
Isabelle expression**. `set ⇒ a set` does not mean the same thing as `set ⇒ 'a
set`: in Isabelle's type syntax `a` names a type constructor and `'a` is a type
variable, and a visitor of this site is an Isabelle user who writes the second.
An earlier framing here — that the quote is punctuation the visitor does not think
of as content — was simply wrong; the quote is what makes it a type variable.

The property that makes the split harmless is that **the quote is visible on both
sides**: the card prints `?'a set ⇒ ?'a set`, and any legal expression the visitor
types carries the quote too, so both tokenize to the same stray `'` in the same
place and the run matches. It is unlike a folded subscript, where `x⇩1` indexes as
`x` and the visitor cannot see what to omit. A stray `'` costs a match only when
the visitor leaves out a character that is really there, which is a typo.

The cost of accepting the proposal was also concrete: `'` in the separator class
collapses every primed name, so `sorted'` and `sorted` become indistinguishable
across **158,120 expressions (11.61 %) and 47,768 names (3.51 %)**. (This read
150,679 and 41,554 / 3.05 % until 2026-08-19; re-measured that day, both were low,
while the 179,860 / 13.20 % and 169,005 in the same subsection reproduced to the
record. Counted precisely: a record is included when its subtoken array holds a
subtoken that contains a `'` **and is longer than one character** — that is, a primed
identifier rather than the stray bare quote the previous paragraph is about. The
earlier pair was reported without its counting rule, which is why it could not be
reproduced; state the rule with any figure that replaces it.) A third option — letting
a leading quote attach to the following identifier, as Isabelle's own lexer does —
was measured and buys nothing: the document holds `'a` either way, so a visitor
who omits the quote still fails to match.

### 14.8 Two other ways to count requests: Analytics Engine, and an edge rule alone

Both were proposed by the user on 2026-08-14 — "我们能用 Workers Analytics Engine
来实现每天 1000 次的 gate 吗？" and, once the first was answered, "既然如此的话，我
觉得 KV 其实不是必须的？我们可以用边缘规则设定每小时 100 个查询的上限？" — and both
were rejected on how the platform behaves, not on preference. The facts were
established in that day's investigation and are recorded here because §11.1 argues
only about KV, so without them the next person costing this out re-proposes the
edge rule and builds a counter that silently counts per data centre:

- **Workers Analytics Engine cannot gate anything.** Its writes are sampled, so the
  count it reports is an estimate; and it is read through an external HTTP SQL API,
  which a request-path Worker would have to call synchronously. A gate needs an exact
  count it can read cheaply, which is the one thing this product does not offer.
- **A Cloudflare edge rate limiting rule counts per data centre, not globally.**
  The counter is implicitly keyed by the colo serving the request, so a rule written
  as "100 per hour" admits 100 per hour *per colo*. That is why layer 1 is per-IP and
  short-window (where per-colo counting is close enough, since one client normally
  lands in one colo) and why a **global** gate cannot be an edge rule at all — it is
  the reason layer 3 was specified as a Durable Object, the only stateful component
  in the design.

### 14.9 A `spell:` field, so a private-use symbol indexes as a readable word

Raised and abandoned by the user on 2026-08-18, both within the hour. The problem
is real: 135 phi-System symbols sit in the Unicode private-use area, where the code
point carries no meaning to any reader or tokenizer. His first proposal was a rule —
"如果有 spell 字段，则始终用此字段；如果没有，且如果 codepoint 位于私用区那么不翻译"
— which would have added a per-symbol `spell:` field to the symbols files so that
`\<transforms>` indexed as a word. He then withdrew it himself: "等一下，我意识到其实
我们不应该给 spells，应该就保留成 `\<transforms>` 好了。对，我们先定下来删除这些
codepoints 的 spell 字段好了."

D44 keeps the surviving clause — a private-use code point is not substituted, so the
escape survives as literal text and at least spells the word. The abandoned clause is
recorded here so that the D43-D46 review §16.7 still owes does not propose it as new:
it is not an oversight, it is a design the user considered and dropped, and no
`spell:` field exists in any symbols file today.

### 14.10 Refusing conditioned searches whose match count exceeds the router's line

Proposed during the 2026-08-26 adversarial review of §6.3c and rejected: refuse any
search whose condition matches more than the 3 % line, so that the site has one rank
mode and one guarantee. Rejected on three grounds. The approximate branch is a good
answer, not a failure — measured 169–200/200 of the exact top 200 at 40–65 ms across
every shape tried, where an error page returns nothing. D7 does not extend to it: D7
rejects a query for which no ranking exists; here a ranking exists and is essentially
right, and stretching D7 to cover "a ranking that is 99.5 % correct" would change what
the rule is about. And the refusal copy would have to teach visitors an internal
threshold the interface otherwise never exposes. A narrower shape-scoped refusal
(exclusion-dominated searches only) was also weighed; the user instead ruled
(2026-08-26) that above-the-line searches, negations included, are served and tagged
approximate. Do not re-raise without new evidence — specifically, telemetry showing
the under-fill fallback or the approximate tag firing at rates that change the
product story.

### 14.11 Precomputing condition match counts at export time

Proposed as an elegance win over §6.3c's live count round (counts are static per
namespace) and refuted on arithmetic. A per-token document-frequency table bounds a
sequence's count only from above — `count(sequence) ≤ min over its tokens` — and the
bound is loosest exactly where routing matters: `f x = x` has 142 true matches while
its every token is ubiquitous (`=` alone: 655,804), so the bound routes the motivating
case to the branch that returned 2 of its 142. Bigram tables (the 833,380-pair
statistics archived in §13 Q14) tighten the bound and still cannot reach 142 for a
four-token sequence, and no static table can price a user-written regex at all. The
live count stays. (Memoising it — a pure function of (namespace, filter tree), and
namespaces are immutable per release — remains available as a later optimisation in
the Worker's existing KV binding; that is a cache of the live count, not a
replacement.)

## 15. Implementation handover, 2026-08-14 — superseded

Moved to `SEMANTIC_SEARCH_SITE_PLAN_DONE.md` §15. It is superseded by §16, which was
written at the next context boundary and says what changed; citations elsewhere to
§15.1, §15.3 and §15.4 resolve into that file. Its §15.1, the copy rewrite, is
complete, and its §15.4's two reviews have both been overtaken — the first has run and
its evidence is in `site/review/` (§16.7), and what is left unreviewed is D43-D46,
which postdate §15 entirely.

## 16. Tokenizer freeze — detailed handover, 2026-08-14

Written at a second context boundary, immediately before the tokenizer work
begins. §15 remains valid except where this section says otherwise. Everything
needed to start is here; nothing below should have to be recovered from the
conversation that produced it.

### 16.0 What changed since §15 was written

**§15.1, the copy rewrite, is complete.** `site/COPY.md` is at draft 3 and is
the authoritative source of every visitor-facing string.
`site/design/IsaSearch.dc.html` has been brought in line with it. Both are
committed. Do not re-derive copy from §9 of this plan or from the mockup — the
mockup follows `COPY.md`, never the reverse.

Three rounds of reader testing produced drafts 1→2→3; `COPY.md` §12 records what
each round changed and, more importantly, **what was rejected and why**. Do not
re-raise those.

**Corrections landed in this plan**, each in place:

- **D30 amended** by the user: the disclosure's second sentence loses the word
  `authoritative`.
- **D39's worked example corrected.** It gave
  `HOL-Analysis.Path_Connected.path_image_join` as an indexed name. No such name
  exists — an Isabelle fact's long name is qualified by the **theory base name**,
  never by the session, and no entity name in the store carries a session prefix.
  The export indexes the stored name unchanged. `theory_subtokens`, by contrast,
  **is** session-qualified. The two fields genuinely differ and the interface
  says so.
- **§9.3 corrected.** There is no `etc/abbrevs` file. The abbreviations are the
  `abbrev:` fields of `etc/symbols` (line 189 gives `\<Longrightarrow>` the
  abbreviation `==>`). **The tokenizer does not convert `==>`** — measured,
  `tokenize('==>')` returns `['==>']`. Only `\<…>` escapes are converted, by
  `unicode_of_ascii` in pipeline step 3. `==>` works solely because the input
  control rewrites the box before the condition is sent. This distinction is
  load-bearing for both the JavaScript port and the copy.
- **§6.5 corrected.** Its second reason for carrying BM25 — a degradation path
  when the embedding budget is exhausted — was deleted by D35 and had been left
  in. Also recorded there: BM25 indexes **only `interpretation`**, not the name
  and not the expression.

**The prototype and the probe harness are in the repository**, no longer in a
scratchpad: `site/prototype/`, with a `README.md` saying what they are and when
`isabelle_tokenizer.py` replaces them. **They are pre-D43 and D43 postdates this
whole subsection** — §16.1 states exactly what that costs and what it does not.

**And the review §16.7 required has since run.** Its brief, its frozen bar, its four
lens reports and its rebuttal are committed under `site/review/`, with a `README.md`
saying which numbers in it were superseded on 2026-08-17. §16.7 below is kept in the
present tense because it records what the review was asked and why; read it as the
brief that was given, not as work outstanding.

### 16.1 The artefacts, and what each is for

```
site/prototype/subtoken_rule.py       the settled separator class + subtokens(), with the fallback clause
site/prototype/tokenize_prototype.py  tokenize(), plus the superseded subtoken variants the measurements compared
site/prototype/corpus_probe.py        counts how many entities a condition matches, on the real corpus
site/prototype/README.md              what these are; delete none of them until the CI gate is green
site/prototype/baseline/              the prototype's whole-corpus output, frozen and stamped (§16.3 step 1)
site/tokenizer/                       the JavaScript port, the asset, the committed inputs and the gate (§16.5, §16.6)
```

`corpus_probe.py` reproduces every match count quoted in this plan and in
`COPY.md`. Verified from its committed location on 2026-08-14 and again on 2026-08-19:
`?n + ?m = ?m + ?n` → 0, `?a + ?b = ?b + ?a` → 15, in 25 s over 1,362,096 records. Run
a third time on 2026-08-19 after the authority's store was synced here, it gives the
**same two answers** over the authority's 1,336,979 expressions, in 20 s — so the
match counts this plan and `COPY.md` quote survive the change of corpus, which is not
something the earlier verifications could have shown. It
resolves `ISABELLE_HOME` and the package paths relative to itself, so it runs from
anywhere. **Use it rather than writing a new probe**; a differently-written probe
is a second implementation of the matching rule and will disagree eventually.

**These files implement the pre-D43 rule, and here is exactly what that costs.**
`tokenize_prototype.py` calls `symbol_explode`, which D43 deleted, and its
`_is_letter` unions in the `letter`/`greek` groups of `etc/symbols`, which §5.2 says
are not consulted. Both were measured on 2026-08-19:

- The `symbol_explode` difference is **exactly the 3,135 records D43 names**. The two
  definitions agree on the other 1,358,961 expressions, element for element. So no
  corpus figure in this plan is at risk from the prototype's age **unless it is one of
  those 3,135 records** — and none of the quoted figures is.
- The letter-group difference is **nothing at all**: all 190 group members satisfy
  `isalpha()`, and every one has a code point that step 3 substitutes before token
  formation sees it (§5.2).
- §16.2's cases and §5.3's 11 relations were re-run under **both** definitions, with
  **zero mismatches under either**. Neither table is prototype-stale and neither needs
  re-deriving. The re-run covered §16.2 as it stood that day; the four escape-scanning
  cases added later (`\<=`, `\<alpha>`, `\< \<alpha>`, `\<\<alpha>`) came from the
  user's own worked examples and from §5.1 step 3a rather than from the prototype, and
  are the four to check first when the production tokenizer runs §16.3's step 1.

So the prototype remains usable as the measuring instrument for match counts, which is
what `corpus_probe.py` is for, and it is **not** a specification of the tokenizer.
Where it and §5 disagree, §5 wins; §16.3 step 1 says how the production
implementation is accepted, and it is not by agreeing with these files.

### 16.2 The facts a correct implementation must reproduce

Every line below was measured on 2026-08-14 with the prototype. They are the
seed of the test-vector file (§16.5) and the acceptance criteria for the port.
`→` gives the **subtokens**, which is the only level that is indexed (D21).

The separator class is **99 characters**, and each third of it comes from somewhere
different (§5.4): `_` and `.` are **ASCII literals in the rule itself**; the seven
control symbols `⇩⇧⇘⇙⇗⇖❙` are **read from a symbols file** by name; and the 90
rendered sub/superscript characters are what `SUBSUP_TRANS_TABLE` produces from `⇩`
and `⇧` — a **hand-maintained** 142-entry dict in `Isabelle_RPC_Host/unicode.py`. No
symbol file carries folding information of any kind, so the fold table has to ship in
the asset (D45). An earlier draft of this paragraph said nine of the 99 come from
`etc/symbols`, which over-counts by two: `_` and `.` are not in any symbols file.

```
'sorted_wrt R ?xs'            → ['sorted','wrt','R','xs']
'Kelly_1_39 ?C ?T ?a'         → ['Kelly','1','39','C','T','a']
'Stirling_Formula.c = ln (2*pi)/2'
                              → ['Stirling','Formula','c','=','ln','(','2','*','pi',')','/','2']
'f x + y'                     → ['f','x','+','y']
'x y'                         → ['x','y']
'_wrt'                        → ['wrt']            ← a leading separator vanishes
'F'                           → ['F']
'\<Longrightarrow>'           → ['⟹']              ← escape converted in step 3
'::'                          → ['::']             ← ASCII-symbolic run stays one token
'-->'                         → ['-->']
'==>'                         → ['==>']            ← NOT ⟹; see §16.0
'x\<^sub>i + y\<^sup>T'      → ['x','+','y']      ← folded subscripts are separators
'f\<^bsub>i\<^esub> = g'     → ['f','i','=','g']  ← bracketed sub/superscript controls likewise
'\<^bold>x \<^bold>('        → ['𝐱','(']          ← bold folds into the letter; a stranded ❙ vanishes
'[x]\<^sup>c\<^sup>e'        → ['[','x',']','ᶜᵉ'] ← THE FALLBACK CLAUSE, see below
'f\<^sub>1'                  → ['f']
'a?b'                         → ['a','b']          ← `?` divides as well as vanishing
'?a + ?b' ≡ '?a+?b' ≡ 'a+b'  → ['a','+','b']      ← spacing does not change these; but whitespace IS a boundary (§5.2)
'HOL-Analysis.Path_Connected.path_image_join'
                              → ['HOL','-','Analysis','Path','Connected','path','image','join']
'Path_Connected.path_image_join'
                              → ['Path','Connected','path','image','join']
"f'"                          → ["f'"]             ← `'` is a quasi-letter, not a separator
'\<=', unconverted           → ['\<=']            ← one ASCII-symbolic run; the user's own example
'\<binit>', undefined        → ['\<','binit','>']  ← an escape step 3a did not convert just splits
'\<alpha>'                   → ['α']              ← and one it did convert does not
'\< \<alpha>'                → ['\<','α']          ← step 3a converts the second; the first is a bare run
'\<\<alpha>'                 → ['\<','α']          ← same, with no space between them
'x1'                          → ['x1']             ← a digit CONTINUES an identifier; it does not start a numeral
'f 100'                       → ['f','100']         ← a maximal run of digits is one token
'f 1000'                      → ['f','1000']        ← so the condition '100' does NOT match this
'1 / 10\<^sup>2'             → ['1','/','10','²']  ← a rendered superscript digit is NOT part of the run
'x-y'                         → ['x','-','y']
'%x. x'                       → ['%','x','x']      ← `%` is not converted to λ by the tokenizer
'_'  '.'  '?'  '   '  '???'  '_.'  '\<^sub>'   → [] (all seven)
```

**Why the unconverted-escape row names `\<binit>` and not `\<alpha>`.** Until
2026-08-19 that row read `'\<alpha>', unconverted → ['\<','alpha','>']`, and no
implementation could ever produce it: `\<alpha>` is defined in every symbol table
there is, so step 3a converts it and the array is `['α']`. The prototype the row was
attributed to returns `['α']` too, so the row had never been measured — it was §5.1
step 3a's illustrative sentence transcribed as if it were a case. §16.1 had already
warned that these four escape rows came from the user's worked examples and from
§5.1 rather than from the prototype, and named them the four to check first when the
production tokenizer ran §16.3 step 1; that check found this one on 2026-08-19 and
the user settled the repair the same day — **change the input, not the expectation**,
so that the property the row exists to pin is kept. `\<binit>` is one of the four AFP
Shivers-CFA escapes §5.1 already cites as unconvertible by any asset, so it is
undefined by construction rather than by assumption. The added `'\<alpha>' → ['α']`
row covers the conversion the old row accidentally hid.

**The fallback clause is the one piece of the rule that prose alone loses.**
Splitting a token on the separator class normally yields its parts; but a token
made **entirely** of rendered sub/superscript characters would yield nothing and
disappear. Such a token survives whole instead — which is why
`[x]\<^sup>c\<^sup>e` keeps `ᶜᵉ`. `subtoken_rule.py` implements it; §5.4 describes
it; any reimplementation that omits it passes most tests and silently drops a
class of real superscripted operators.

**Matching, for completeness** (this is §6.3, not the tokenizer, but the copy and
the tests depend on it): a condition matches when its subtokens appear as an
**adjacent, ordered run** — whole parts only. Measured: `sorted` matches
`sorted_wrt`; **`sort` does not**; `image_join` matches
`Path_Connected.path_image_join`; `join_path` does not. `COPY.md` §0 states this
for visitors and must not drift from it.

Corpus scale, for sizing anything, measured on `cslh19` because the user ruled it
authoritative: **1,343,793** records carry a name, **1,336,979** carry an expression,
and **1,337,025** are exportable before D24's scope test — the difference being the
**6,768** `EXPERIENCE` records, which are never published. (Until the user synced the
authority's store here on 2026-08-19, this machine reported 1,362,343 / 1,362,096 /
1,362,163 with only 180 `EXPERIENCE` records, 18,550 records higher. It now reports
the authority's figures; §3.1 tabulates both generations and §3's preamble carries
the digest that tells them apart.)

### 16.3 Build order, with an acceptance test for each step

Do these in order. Each step is finished when its test passes, not before.

**Where this stands, 2026-08-20: all six steps are done.** Step 2 was the last, and
it was waiting only on an export to emit the asset *from*; that export is now written
(§8.1) and emits it. §12.2's prerequisites A, B and C are all done as of the same
day. The apparatus around steps 1 and 3 to 5 was rebuilt on 2026-08-20 after an
adversarial review — §16.5 and §16.6 say what it is now and what the previous shape
failed to enforce.

1. **`site/tokenizer/isabelle_tokenizer.py`** (in the `Isabelle_Semantic_Embedding`
   package until 2026-08-26 — see §5.5) — the production
   Python implementation, lifted from `site/prototype/` and changed in **two**
   respects, not the one an earlier draft of this step claimed:
   **(i)** it reads its character classes and its two tables from the emitted asset
   (§16.4) instead of from Python built-ins and a live `Isabelle_RPC_Host` import; and
   **(ii)** it drops `symbol_explode` and iterates characters, per D43, and stops
   consulting the `letter`/`greek` groups of `etc/symbols`, per §5.2.

   *Accepted when* both of these hold:

   - It reproduces **every line of §16.2**, all 33 of them, and every relation in
     §5.3. Both tables have been re-run under the character-level definition with zero
     mismatches (§16.1), so this is a target that is known to be reachable. **Done,
     2026-08-19**: `test_isabelle_tokenizer.py` runs both tables and passes, with the
     one repair §16.2 records — the row that named `\<alpha>` as an unconverted escape
     was unreachable and now names `\<binit>`, which is the reason the table has 33
     rows and not 32.
   - Run over the whole corpus, its subtoken arrays differ from the prototype's on a
     known set and are identical everywhere else. Compare with a digest of the
     concatenated arrays per record, not by eyeballing samples.

     **This comparison runs on the authority's corpus.** The user settled the machine
     on 2026-08-19 and then synced the authority's store to this one, where it was
     verified identical whole (§3's preamble, digest
     `a2dbbb874fe178867dd07bc05901fc96`), so the run happens **here** and needs no
     remote access — check the digest first, and if it does not match, re-sync rather
     than measure. The figures this step used to give — 15,935 differing expressions
     against 1,346,161 identical, of which D43 contributes 3,135 and §5.2's numeric
     class 12,822 expressions and 126,282 names, overlapping on 22 — were taken on the
     **pre-re-key** store that stood here until that sync, which shared not one key
     with the authority, and are superseded by the measurement below.

     **Measured on the authority's corpus, 2026-08-19**, digest confirmed first. The
     prototype's rule is `subtoken_rule.subtokens(tokenize_prototype.tokenize(s))`;
     `tokenize_prototype.subtokens_rev` is a superseded variant with no fallback
     clause, and comparing against that one instead reports tens of thousands of
     spurious differences in which characters the subtokens spell. The two changes
     were separated by running a third rule in the same pass — the production
     tokenizer with every digit excluded from a numeric run, which is exactly how
     digits behaved before §5.2's numeric class existed — so prototype-against-that
     isolates D43 and that-against-production isolates the numeric class.

     ```
     expressions (1,336,979 carry one)      names (1,343,793)
       identical           1,324,122          identical           1,222,628
       differing              12,857          differing             121,165
         D43                     741            D43                       0
         numeric class        12,138            numeric class       121,165
         both                     22            both                      0
     ```

     Of D43's 741 expressions, **738 are pure refinements** — every old subtoken is
     kept or split further — and **3 lose a subtoken**. Those 3 are the whole loss
     set, and they are exactly the three records this step named:
     `AbsCFCorrect.lemma6`, `AbsCFCorrect.contour_a_class.abs_cnt_initial` and
     `Matrix.matrix`. The fourteen phi-System records that used to join them are not
     in the authority's corpus at all, so what §5.1 states as seventeen losses is
     three here, and the expectation has become a measurement.

     **The numeric class loses nothing, and that is what to gate on**: of its 12,138
     expressions and 121,165 names, every one is a pure merge — no record loses a
     subtoken, and none changes the characters its subtokens spell. One failure here
     means the rendered sub/superscript exclusion was not implemented.

     Two further results from the same pass. **Pipeline step 3 is the identity on the
     whole authority corpus**: 0 expressions and 0 names change under symbol
     conversion and folding, which is what §5.1's note about 1,056 phi-System
     expressions predicts once phi-System is out of the store. And comparing the
     prototype directly against the production tokenizer reports **25** expressions
     that are neither a pure refinement nor a pure merge — that is the 3 losses plus
     the 22 that D43 refines *and* the numeric class merges, where the two changes
     together leave the boundaries in neither relation. Only the 3 are losses, so the
     loss test has to be applied to each change separately and not to their
     composition.

     **The prototype's side of this comparison is frozen** (approved 2026-08-19).
     `site/prototype/baseline/` holds the run: `baseline.json` with its provenance —
     which store, which four symbol files, which `Isabelle_RPC` revision, the SHA-256
     of the four source files the run depended on, the Unicode version — every count
     above, and in full each of the 25 records that is neither a pure refinement nor a
     pure merge; `asset.json`, the exact asset used; and `baseline.classes.zst`, one
     byte per record per change per field in key-digest order, so a later run can name
     *which* record moved rather than only that one did. The prototype reads a live
     symbol table through a live `Isabelle_RPC_Host` import, so without this the target
     of the comparison moves whenever anything underneath it moves. Re-running
     `build_baseline.py` on a store whose digest matches reproduces all three byte for
     byte — verified by running it twice.

   **An earlier draft of this step required the arrays to be *identical* to the
   prototype's for all 1,362,096 expressions.** That test cannot pass and must not be
   restored: by D43 the two definitions **must** differ, and gating the production
   tokenizer on agreeing with the rule §5 replaced would have accepted only an
   implementation that ignored D43.

2. **Asset emission in the export** (§16.4). *Accepted when* the asset loads
   standalone, with `Isabelle_RPC_Host` and `ISABELLE_HOME` unavailable; step 1's
   corpus comparison still passes; the asset carries a `tokenizer_rule` version; and
   **an asset whose `tokenizer_rule` the implementation does not know is refused
   rather than read** (§5.5). Test the refusal by hand-editing the version in a copy —
   it is the one behaviour no other test exercises.

   **Done, 2026-08-20.** The export exists (§8.1) and emits the asset; what it builds
   on this machine is byte-identical to the committed `site/tokenizer/asset.json`,
   digest `9f86eadd64f0…`, and the corpus comparison of step 1 has not moved.
   `site/tokenizer/tokenizer_asset.py`
   builds the asset and every one of the four conditions above is met and tested:
   `test_isabelle_tokenizer.py` loads the tokenizer module by path with
   `Isabelle_RPC_Host` and `Isabelle_Semantic_Embedding` blocked from the import system
   and `ISABELLE_HOME` removed from the environment, and it edits the version in a copy
   of the asset and asserts the refusal — the JavaScript side does the same in
   `site/tokenizer/test_tokenizer.mjs`. What is left is wiring the emission into an
   export that does not exist. That is no longer a wait: §12.2's prerequisites B (the
   theory-hash registry published) and C (entity positions in the published snapshot)
   both landed on 2026-08-20, so the export is writable now. Meanwhile
   `site/tokenizer/asset.json` is the committed asset, and `test_isabelle_tokenizer.py`
   checks it is still what the live symbol table produces — which is the question the
   export will answer automatically once it emits the asset itself.

3. **`site/tokenizer/`** — the JavaScript port, reading the same asset.
   *Accepted when* it passes the shared test-vector file (§16.5) with zero
   mismatches. It must not consult any JavaScript built-in for character
   classification — see D41 for the measured divergences that motivates this.
   **Done, 2026-08-19**: `site/tokenizer/isabelle_tokenizer.js`, which reproduced every
   committed input with zero mismatches on its first run, and does so today against
   the digest of §16.6. It is written to be read beside the Python
   file — same order, same names, same algorithm — because two implementations of one
   specification drift where they are two readings of prose and stay together where
   they are one algorithm written twice. The one place they had differed was §5.4's
   split, a character-class regular expression in Python against an explicit loop in
   JavaScript; the Python side is now the explicit loop too, verified against the
   frozen baseline's whole-corpus digests, which did not move. `asset.json` is
   committed beside the vectors, because the port cannot build one and a gate that ran
   the two implementations against different assets would prove nothing.

4. **The shared test-vector file** (§16.5). Build it before step 3 so the port
   has a target. **Done, 2026-08-19; rebuilt in a different shape 2026-08-20** after
   an adversarial review measured that the first shape did not enforce §5.5:
   `site/tokenizer/inputs.jsonl`, 15,253 inputs and no committed expectations, with
   `expected.json`, `toy_asset.json` and `build_inputs.py` beside it. §16.5 says what
   is in it and §16.6 why it has that shape.

5. **The CI gate** (§16.6). **Done, 2026-08-19**:
   `.github/workflows/tokenizer-gate.yml`, two jobs. The Python job runs
   `test_isabelle_tokenizer.py` and `emit.py --check`; the JavaScript job runs
   `emit.mjs --check` and `test_tokenizer.mjs`. Both `--check` runs compare the same
   digest on purpose, since the claim being gated is that the two implementations
   agree.

   **It installs neither Isabelle nor this package, and that is load-bearing rather
   than thrifty.** The tokenizer reads its classes and its two tables from the asset
   and needs nothing else, which is the property §5.5 exists to establish, so a gate
   that needed the Isabelle stack would contradict what it is gating. It also could
   not have it: `isabelle-rpc` is published to conda and not to PyPI, deliberately, so
   a plain runner cannot `pip install` this package at all. Verified by running the
   whole suite in a tree holding nothing but `site/`, the one tokenizer module and the
   test file: 62 passed, 1 skipped. The one that skips is the one that needs a live
   symbol table — that the committed `asset.json` is still what that table produces —
   and it runs on a developer's machine, where the answer can be had.

6. **`_truncate_to_token_limit`** — **decided 2026-08-19: the site does not use it,
   and it stays exactly where it is.** It counts the embedding model's BPE tokens
   through `transformers.AutoTokenizer`, and the site has no place to call that from.
   On the query path the enforcement point is the Worker, which D29 capped in
   *characters* precisely because a Worker cannot count BPE tokens without shipping a
   151,000-entry vocabulary to the edge; 8,000 characters is what keeps a query inside
   Fireworks' input limit. On the export path there is nothing to truncate: the export
   publishes vectors that already exist in the store and embeds nothing. Its only
   callers are `_shrink_tokens` and itself, all inside `premise_selection.py`, which
   is AoA's premise selection and not this site. Moving it would have taken a
   `transformers` import into a module the site does use, for no caller.
   Note that `premise_selection.py` imports the symbol conversion as
   `_pretty_unicode` and wraps it rather than shadowing it, so nothing there is
   affected by the tokenizer landing.

**Two callers unpack the tokenizer's output by arity** and will break if the return
shape changes: `site/prototype/tokenize_prototype.py`'s own `__main__` block, and
`contrib/Isabelle_RPC/test_unicode.py`, which does
`symbols, reverse, _, _ = get_SYMBOLS_AND_REVERSED()`. An earlier note here said there
was exactly one. Neither is production code; both are in-repository and must be
updated in the same commit.

### 16.4 What the asset is, and why it exists (D41, D45, D46)

§5.2 defines the character classes by naming Python's `isalpha`, `isdigit`,
`isnumeric` and `isspace`. JavaScript has no equivalent, and the obvious
substitutes **disagree on real corpus characters** — this is measured, not
hypothetical:

- `²` (U+00B2, **3,955** occurrences over the whole corpus; an earlier draft said 640,
  which is the count over §3.3's 230,944-document test namespace) satisfies `isdigit()` but
  is Unicode category `No`, so `\p{Nd}` disagrees.
- U+001C–U+001F and U+0085 satisfy Python's `isspace()` but lie outside
  JavaScript's `\s`.
- U+FEFF is the reverse: inside `\s`, outside `isspace()`.

So the export emits, beside the symbol table, the explicit code-point sets for:
**letters** (`isalpha()` alone — the `letter`/`greek` groups of `etc/symbols` add nothing,
see §5.2), **the fold table** `SUBSUP_TRANS_TABLE` without which the port cannot fold at
all and cannot tell which 90 of the 99 separators are rendered characters,
**digits**, **quasi-letters** (`_` and `'`), **the separator class** (all 99
characters), and **the ASCII-symbolic set** (`! # $ % & * + - / : < = > @ \ ^ | ~`).
Neither implementation may consult a language built-in for any of these.

**The three code-point range lists are ascending and non-overlapping, and both
implementations refuse an asset where they are not.** Membership is a parity test over
the range boundaries, so a list out of order does not fail — it answers wrongly for
every character, in both languages, with no error anywhere. `tokenizer_asset` cannot
emit such a list, but the asset is committed and hand-editable, and the first
hand-written one got it wrong.

**Emit the `tokenizer_rule` version too**, an integer identifying the rules of §5.1,
§5.2 and §5.4 that produced this asset (D45 as amended 2026-08-19). It is the only
field here that is not data: everything else describes characters, and this describes
the code that consumes them. It exists because the digest names the namespace (§8.2),
and without it a rule change that touches no table — §5.2's numeric token class, which
reuses the digit set already shipped — leaves the digest and therefore the namespace
name unchanged, so a new index is written over the live one and a Worker running the
old rules addresses it as though nothing had happened. Bump it by hand in the same
commit as the rule change; §5.5 requires both implementations to refuse an asset whose
version they do not implement.

Emit the abbreviation table too, from the `abbrev:` fields of `etc/symbols` —
the interface needs it for live replacement in the condition box (§9.3). Note that an
abbreviation with more than one expansion
(`.>` and `<.` each serve four or more arrows) cannot be replaced without
asking, so the interface uses the unambiguous ones only. **This sentence used to end
"and it is already being read", which is not true of anything in the repository**:
`_load_symbols` in `Isabelle_RPC_Host/unicode.py` parses the `code:` and `group:`
fields and no other, so emitting abbreviations means teaching that shared loader a
third field. `tokenizer_asset.py` therefore does not emit them yet; the condition box
that needs them is §9.3's work and has not started.

**What `tokenizer_asset.py` emits, and three choices it makes that this section did
not settle** (2026-08-19, with §16.3 step 1):

- **A private-use symbol is dropped from the table rather than shipped.** D44 leaves
  such a symbol as its literal `\<name>`, which is exactly what an undefined symbol
  does, so dropping it makes the two cases one case and spares the JavaScript port a
  private-use range check of its own — a rule each implementation would otherwise
  have to carry, which is what §5.5 exists to prevent. The names dropped are listed
  in the asset under `symbols_private_use`, so nothing is lost, only moved out of the
  lookup table.
- **The whitespace class and the discard class ship as well.** This section's list
  omits them while its own second bullet gives the reason they cannot be omitted —
  U+001C–U+001F and U+0085 satisfy Python's `isspace()` and lie outside JavaScript's
  `\s`, and U+FEFF is the reverse. Without them in the asset the port has to ask
  `\s`, which §5.5 forbids. Read as an omission from the list, not as a decision.
- **The 99 separators, the 90 rendered sub/superscripts and the 20 rendered digits
  §5.2 excludes from a numeric run are each emitted outright**, rather than left for
  a consumer to derive from the fold table. §5.4 warns that an implementation
  deriving one of these classes from another will drift the moment the fold table
  gains an entry; deriving all three here, once, from the fold table, is that warning
  obeyed rather than repeated in two languages.

### 16.5 The test-vector file

At least **10,000 inputs** sampled from real entity
expressions — the expected outputs are computed rather than committed, for the reason
§16.6 gives — **plus** synthetic cases, because real expressions cannot exercise
pipeline steps 1 and 3 at all. §3.4 establishes both halves of that, and the second
half needs care: the store is 100 % NFC, so step 1 is the identity on it; and step 3
is the identity **on the corpus that is published**, though not on the store as a
whole — since the loader began reading the table Isabelle actually presents it changes
1,056 stored expressions, and D24 excludes every one of them, all being phi-System.
So a port that omits NFC normalisation and escape conversion passes a
purely-real-data gate byte for byte, and then returns nothing for
`\<Longrightarrow>` — one of the two input routes §9.3 promises.

The synthetic cases must include, at minimum: every line of §16.2; ASCII-escaped
input; NFD input; sub/superscripts that have no fold entry; separator-only
conditions; the `²` and U+FEFF boundary characters; U+001C–U+001F and U+0085; a token
made entirely of rendered superscripts, for the fallback clause; an escape carrying a
**private-use** code point, which D44 requires to survive as its literal `\<name>`; an
escape sitting against an ASCII-symbolic character, which is D43's 17-record loss
pattern; an **astral** symbol value such as `\<S>` → `𝒮`, which is what catches a
JavaScript port iterating UTF-16 code units (§5.2); **two, three and four adjacent
fold markers** (`x⇩⇩1`, `x⇩⇩⇩1`, `x⇩⇩⇩⇩1`), which no sample can draw because zero of
`cslh19`'s 1,343,793 records carry the pattern and which is the one case where a port
folding each marker separately diverges from step 3b's non-overlapping scan; **the
four escape-scanning cases the user worked through himself** on 2026-08-18 — `\<=`,
`\<alpha>`, `\< \<alpha>` and `\<\<alpha>` — none of which was gated by anything
before 2026-08-19 although §5.1 step 3a's rule was written to answer them; and
five cases for §5.2's numeric class, every one of which a 10,000-triple sample of
real expressions can miss — **a digit abutting a rendered sub/superscript** (`2²`,
`1 / 10²`), whose corpus frequency is 373 in 1,362,096 — 372 in the authority's
1,336,979, re-measured 2026-08-19 — so a sample of that size
draws about three and can easily draw none; **a standalone multi-digit numeral**
(`f 100`); **a digit immediately following a letter** (`x1`), which is the only
guard against the precedence misreading §5.2 warns about; **a CJK numeral followed
by a letter** (`一x`), which is what still discriminates the letter-before-digit
ordering now that `一二三` no longer does; and **an astral digit adjacent to an ASCII
digit** (`1\<one>2`, where `\<one>` is `𝟭` at U+1D7ED), because 1,112 of the 1,912
digit code points are astral and a port iterating UTF-16 code units now swallows its
neighbours into a token nothing can match, where before it merely emitted a lone
surrogate.

Pin the file's **encoding, ordering, count and digest**, so that "both
implementations passed" is itself a checkable claim rather than a report.

**Built 2026-08-19 and rebuilt 2026-08-20 in a different shape, after an adversarial
review measured that the first one did not do what this section asks.** What is
committed now:

- `inputs.jsonl` — one JSON object per line, `{"id","feature","input"}`. **15,253
  inputs and no expected outputs**: 10,037 real expressions, 2,024 real names, 119
  hand-written cases, and 3,073 generated from the asset's own keys.
- `expected.json` — 334 bytes. The tokenizer rule, the asset digest, the inputs digest
  and the count, and **one digest of the output** both implementations must reproduce.
- `toy_asset.json` — §5.5's property, settled by construction; §16.6 says how.

**Why no expected outputs are committed, which is a change to this section's first
paragraph.** An expectations file is a *recording of what the code currently does*, so
a rule change and a re-recording to match a broken tokenizer are byte-identical acts;
no digest, marker or ledger over such a file can tell them apart. Computing the
expectations in CI and pinning one digest is not a recording: a divergence between the
two implementations moves exactly one digest, and a rule change moves both. That second
case is a feature, not noise — see §16.6. Measured cost of the change: the committed
bytes fall from 7.15 MB to 2.47 MB, so the real sample did **not** have to be cut, and
a proposal to cut it from 10,000 to 2,000 was withdrawn once it was measured — 275
single-code-point asset mutations are detectable by the 12,061 real inputs and only
205 survive at 2,006, with 42 of the 70 lost ones covered by nothing else.

Four things about it that this section did not settle:

- **Real names are sampled as well as real expressions.** §16.5 says expressions, but
  `name_subtokens` is a shipped field (§6.1) and names have a shape expressions do not
  — dotted long names, `(3)` suffixes on dynamic members, the folded sub/superscripts
  that make up half of `DocumentPointer`'s naming. A port that tokenizes expressions
  correctly and names wrongly would pass an expressions-only file.
- **The sample is drawn by a rule each record decides on its own**: the leading four
  bytes of its key digest for its expression, the trailing four for its name, each
  against a threshold. No ordering pass, no seed, and reproducible from the store
  `build_inputs.py` names.
- **The generated half exists because the corpus cannot supply what it covers, and it
  embeds each key in context rather than emitting it bare.** Every symbol-table key,
  every fold-table key and the ordered marker cross-product, each bare and embedded
  between letters, between digits and between separators. The embedding is
  load-bearing: a lone non-letter tokenizes to itself either way, so a bare `\<G>`
  cannot detect `𝒢` being dropped from the letter class, while `x\<G>y` can —
  measured, 54 of 70 otherwise-undetectable single-code-point mutations hang on it.
  This closes the 18 symbol names carrying a digit, `_` or `'` that no corpus record
  contains, permanently rather than for the names someone thought of; before it,
  narrowing the escape pattern to `[A-Za-z]*` passed every test.
- **U+0085, U+2028 and U+2029 are escaped, although JSON does not require it.** JSON
  escapes everything below U+0020 and leaves those three raw, and all three are line
  terminators to Python's `str.splitlines` and to a good many other line readers — so
  a line-oriented file could contain a line break inside a line. Real corpus text
  contains them. The gate also asserts that splitting on LF and splitting on
  everything give the same number of lines, so a future generator that forgets this
  is caught rather than trusted.

### 16.6 The CI gate

**Retirement pending (2026-08-26).** Q14's final ruling removed tokenization
from search; the gate below guards columns that the next re-export drops. The
gate, `site/tokenizer/`, and the ML-side twin retire with that release. The
section stands until then — the live namespace still carries the columns.

Each implementation tokenizes the committed inputs (§16.5), hashes the result, and
compares that hash with the one in `expected.json`. Both compare the same number, so
"both implementations agree" is one claim checked twice rather than two reports. The
gate also runs, per language, the hand-written cases of §16.2 and §5.3 and the toy
asset below.

**A digest of computed output rather than a file of committed expectations, and why
that is the whole design.** An expectations file records what the code currently does.
Change a rule, regenerate, and it agrees with the new behaviour — including when the
new behaviour is a bug — so a legitimate change and a re-recording that hides a
regression are the same act at the byte level, and no digest, marker or ledger laid
over that file can separate them. A digest of *computed* output records nothing: the
only way to make a broken tokenizer agree with it is to fix the tokenizer.

- A **divergence between the two implementations** moves exactly one digest.
- A **rule change** moves both, and that is a feature. It is what catches a rule change
  that forgot to bump `tokenizer_rule`, which matters because without the bump the
  asset's bytes do not move, so the namespace name does not move, and §8.2's "write
  into a new namespace" quietly becomes an upsert into the live one (§16.4). The
  failure message names that decision rather than asking anyone to remember it.
- Neither case can be resolved by regenerating anything. `emit.py --update` rewrites
  the digest, and the diff is one hex string beside a `tokenizer_rule` that either
  moved or did not.

**The toy asset is how §5.5 is enforced rather than reviewed.** §5.5 forbids either
implementation from carrying a table of its own or consulting a language built-in for a
character class, and until 2026-08-20 nothing checked it: `/\p{L}/u.test(ch)` in place
of the asset's letter set passed all 12,171 vectors and all 17 feature assertions with
zero problems, as did a marker set written out by hand instead of read off the fold
table. Both are natural ways to write the code. They are invisible to any real input
because `isalpha()` and `\p{L}` agree on every character assigned in the asset's
Unicode version — which is also why the damage grows with every browser update and no
code change. `site/tokenizer/toy_asset.json` settles it by construction: fifteen lines
of asset in which every class **contradicts** what a built-in would say — `7` is a
letter, `z` is a digit, `.` is whitespace and the real space is not, `,` is symbolic and
`+` is not — so an implementation that consults a built-in, in either direction,
diverges on the first case. Its 23 expected outputs are derived from §5 by hand rather
than copied from a run, and are measured to catch all twelve single-field substitutions
of the forbidden kinds in both languages.

**What this section used to require, and why it is gone.** It required the gate to fail
"if the file's digest changes without the count changing", with an append-only ledger
and a reviewed `rule-change:` marker as the escape. Measured on 2026-08-20 against a
tokenizer with §5.4's fallback clause removed and the vectors regenerated from it: the
guard caught the case where the ledger was appended to honestly and the count held, and
missed every other path — a line added so the count moved (which §16.5 *instructs* a
rule change to do), the ledger rewritten to one line, the line edited in place, the
marker appended. It also false-alarmed whenever two branches each regenerated, and
nothing checked that the ledger was append-only, so a rebase or a squash rewrote it
silently. A check that misses the case it was written for and rings on cases that are
fine is not weak, it is miscalibrated; it is replaced by the digest above, which does
the one thing the ledger was accidentally doing — making "the behaviour moved" a red
build.

**What the gate cannot do, stated so nobody rediscovers it as a defect.** The inputs
are tokenized by the implementations, so the file cannot validate Python against §5;
it can only bind the two implementations to each other. What validates Python is the
hand-written table of §16.2 and §5.3, which is never regenerated, and the toy asset.
Any case that discriminates a *rule* must therefore be hand-written and must live in
`test_isabelle_tokenizer.py` — a case generated from the implementation cannot
validate the implementation, and this was measured: narrowing Python's escape pattern
and hard-coding Python's marker set both survived the generated half entirely.

### 16.7 The review that ran first — and the one still owed

**This review has run: 2026-08-14, and its evidence is committed under
`site/review/`.** The brief, the bar (written and frozen before any finding existed),
the four lens reports and the rebuttal are all there, with a `README.md` saying which
of its figures were superseded on 2026-08-17 when the symbol-table loader was fixed.
29 findings went in, 19 survived merging, 9 were deleted, 10 stood, and the rebuttal
round found one more itself. Every change it caused is already in §5 and D41. Read
`site/review/` before reopening anything in §5; the rest of this subsection is the
brief that was given, kept because it records *why* the round was run that way.

**What is still owed is a review of D43-D46**, which postdate that round entirely and
are structural: D43 changed what the tokenizer is defined over, D45 made the asset a
single stamped file whose digest names the namespace, and D46 made the component set a
hard failure condition. §12.2's step 3 should not be called finished until they have
been through the same treatment.

Per §15.4, the round that ran was **a narrow adversarial review of §5 and D41, before
writing `isabelle_tokenizer.py`.** Small scope, deep agents. The specific question
asked, because it is the failure mode that a test-vector gate cannot catch:

> Find constructions where two implementations both pass the test vectors and
> still behave differently on real input.

It was given §5 in full, D41, D21, `site/prototype/`, and §16.2, and asked
specifically about: the fallback clause; the boundary between "letter" as `isalpha()`
and as an `etc/symbols` group membership; whether `symbol_explode` could produce a
symbol the separator class splits in half; and NFC stability of every symbol value.
**Three of those four are settled and must not be asked again**: the `etc/symbols`
groups are not consulted (§5.2, and all 190 members satisfy `isalpha()` anyway);
`symbol_explode` no longer exists (D43), so the question about it is about a deleted
step; and §3.4 now records the NFC measurement the question wanted checked — 0 of
1,362,096 expressions and 0 of 1,362,343 names are non-NFC. The fallback clause
survives as a live concern and §5.4 marks it as load-bearing.

**The questions to give the D43-D46 review instead**: whether the character-level rule
can cut a *converted* symbol's code point in half (it cannot — a code point is
atomic — but the JavaScript port iterating UTF-16 code units can, which is §5.2's
astral warning and is worth an adversary); whether the asset's digest can change
without any published document changing, and — the direction that turned out to
matter — whether a **published document can change without the digest changing**,
which is what D45's 2026-08-19 amendment closes and which a reviewer should try to
reopen from a different angle; whether the export's failure on a
different component set can be bypassed by accident (D46, §8.2); and whether the 17
subtoken losses of D43 include anything that is not bare punctuation.

**Method fix, and it is not optional.** In the 2026-08-13 review the rebuttal
round deleted **none** of 35 findings, because the defender was told that killing
a true finding is worse than keeping a weak one, and so passed everything
through. Give the defender an **explicit deletion quota with justification**, and
state the judge's bar **before** the round rather than after. The user's instruction
had said so in advance — "Run an Agent Team for a 2-turn adversarial debate of
reviewing the plan. **重点把低质量的 review 意见删除**" — and the round was run against
it. Two further halves of that same instruction are recorded here because they were
carried out nowhere: **report the concerns to the user in Chinese**, and **change no
code before he agrees**.

**And the round's output was never re-filtered.** D33–D42 descend from those 35
unculled findings, and no pass has since applied the bar the user asked for. That is
not a reason to reopen them wholesale — several are his own decisions taken in the
same conversation — but it is a reason for the D43–D46 review this section still owes
to widen by one question: *which of D33–D42 rest on a finding that would not survive
the deletion quota?*

### 16.8 Sub-questions to settle during the work, not before

- ~~**Does turbopuffer store and index a whitespace-only element in a
  `pre_tokenized_array`?**~~ **Settled 2026-08-20: it does, and `"\n"` stands.**
  §6.3 put it between theory names precisely because the tokenizer can never emit
  it; §8.1's step 0b recorded the probe, which the export re-ran on every run
  rather than trusting the one measurement. It was listed here as a question and
  nowhere as a step, so nothing owned it — that is what making it step 0b fixed.
  **Moot since 2026-08-26 (D55)**: the field holds one theory name, so nothing is
  separated from anything. The probe is deleted. The related question that D55
  *did* have to ask — whether turbopuffer accepts an EMPTY `pre_tokenized_array`
  and leaves it unmatched — was probed the same day against a throwaway
  namespace: it does, the row is never matched by `ContainsTokenSequence`, it IS
  returned by a negation, and it reads back as `[]` rather than as a missing key.
- ~~**What number does the RRF fusion return per row?**~~ **Measured 2026-08-21
  against the live namespace.** With `rerank_by: ["RRF"]` each fused row carries
  exactly one number, in `$dist`, and it is the RRF score itself
  (`Σ weight/(rank_constant + rank)`, `rank_constant` defaulting to 60 — verified
  arithmetically with three parameter combinations). **The per-leg scores are
  dropped**: the vector leg's cosine distance is not recoverable from the
  server-fused response, and no field says which leg matched a row. The same
  multi-query *without* `rerank_by` returns the legs separately, each row with
  its own leg's `$dist` (the vector leg's being the cosine distance D40
  displays). So server-side fusion and D40's display cannot share one round
  trip; fusing client-side over the unfused legs gets both in one. **Which side
  fuses — and whether D40's displayed number survives — is before the user**
  (options tabled 2026-08-21); this bullet only records what the API does.
  Engineering notes that must not be relearned: the fused row cap is root-level
  `limit` (root-level `top_k` is *silently ignored*); a BM25 leg's `$dist` is a
  relevance (higher is better, returned descending); at most 16 legs per
  request, executed with snapshot isolation.
- ~~**Does the f16 conversion change the ranking?**~~ **Measured 2026-08-21,
  end to end on the real published vectors: no.** 20 query vectors (15 spread
  across the id space, 5 topic-picked via BM25), each compared live-top-100
  against exact f32 cosine over the same candidates: top-10 identical and
  top-1 identical on all 20 queries; 2 adjacent swaps in 99,000 ranked pairs,
  both at exact-distance gaps below 2e-6 (ties for any practical purpose);
  displayed `$dist` differs from exact f32 cosine by at most 9.78e-6 — f16
  mantissa quantisation, two orders below display precision. D31's analysis
  holds. (Scope: drift *within* the served candidates; recall is the previous
  bullet's measurement.)
- ~~**Does the approximate-nearest-neighbour search still return the best members of a
  narrow filtered set?**~~ **Measured 2026-08-21 against the real index: yes,
  perfectly.** The two narrowest `kind` values — `proof method` (832 rows) and
  `named theorem bundles` (951 rows), selectivity ~0.06% of 1,337,025 — were
  each queried with three semantically unrelated real query vectors at top_k 20
  and 100 (12 measurements): every one returned the full requested top_k with
  recall 1.000 and an ordering byte-identical to exact cosine over the whole
  filtered set, which is the behaviour of exhaustive scoring inside a mask this
  small. ~~§6.6's guarantee holds; the design problem this bullet feared does not
  exist.~~ **That conclusion was falsified on 2026-08-26** — it generalised from
  one filter shape to all of them. The measurement above remains true *of what it
  measured*: a scalar `kind In` filter selecting a few hundred rows, whose tiny
  mask gets exhaustive scoring. §13 Q14 measured the same question for
  `ContainsTokenSequence` over common tokens and got the opposite answer
  (`f x = x`, 142 true matches, 2 returned) — the loss tracks the filter's
  required-token frequency, not its selectivity, which is why one narrow filter
  is exact and another narrow filter collapses. The design problem this bullet
  feared is real, and §6.3c's count router is the response. Side yield, exact via
  the aggregate endpoint
  (`{"aggregate_by": {"n": ["Count","id"]}}` works): the corpus has exactly 11
  `kind` values — lemma 1,031,439; constant 176,008; introduction rule 58,947;
  elimination rule 28,311; case-split rule 10,193; locale 9,928; type 9,420;
  induction rule 9,091; typeclass 1,905; named theorem bundles 951; proof
  method 832 — summing to the namespace's row count with nothing left over.
- ~~**What are the two source-link URL templates?**~~ **Settled 2026-08-20 by
  D47: there is one template, not two, and it points at pages we render and host
  ourselves.** The investigation this bullet asked for was run first and is what
  killed the external-link answer it assumed: the public pages are static output
  of Isabelle's own HTML presentation with per-entity anchors but no line
  anchors, the AFP side is keyed by session (not entry directory, which 404s for
  20 multi-session entries), and — decisively — both public sites track the
  *current* release while the corpus is pinned, so the user rejected linking out
  and chose self-rendering from the cslh19 umbrella build databases. Findings,
  template, and the pre-upload link-check gate are all recorded in D47. The
  warning this bullet carried survives as D47's gate: a template that 404s is
  worse than the absent form the other cards already show.

### 16.9 What is still blocked, and by whom

**Nothing outside this plan is blocking anything, as of 2026-08-20.** Per §12.2 all
three prerequisites are done: the key repair (D33) on 2026-08-18, the theory-hash
registry (B) and the entity positions reaching the published snapshot (C) on
2026-08-20. The tokenizer freeze never waited on any of them — D33 used to describe
itself as a prerequisite of the whole of phase one, which contradicted this; it is a
prerequisite of steps 4 and 5.

**The site export is written, 2026-08-20**, and it carried step 2's asset emission
with it as expected: `src/site_export.py` (here since the 2026-08-24
migration, §12.1; the `isabelle-semantics site-export` subcommand is
retired). §8.1 says step by step what it does and what each
gate measured; §12.2's step 4 says what stands between it and a production namespace.

Both of those decisions have since been taken and executed: the namespace name
was settled as a base plus a generation (§8.2, 2026-08-20), and **the first
production export ran on 2026-08-20** — 1,337,025 documents live in
`isasearch-2025-2-afp-2026-05-13`, verified against the namespace's metadata.
What remains as of 2026-08-21 is §17's implementation (the source-page upload
pass and the source-link patch) and then §9's interface with §12.2's step-5
Worker.

## 17. The source-page upload pass — design, as ruled by D49 (2026-08-21)

This section is the authority on the one transformation that takes the rendered
tree to the published tree, on the source-link column that D49's ruling 2 adds
to every row, and on the link-check gate that refuses to let either ship
broken. Its first draft went through the adversarial review D49 records; every
figure below was measured against the real rendered tree and the real corpus
during that round.

Terms: **the rendered tree** is `~/.isabelle/Isabelle2025-2/browser_info/` on
cslh19 exactly as `isabelle build -n -o browser_info` left it — read-only
input, never modified. **The published tree** is the fresh output directory
whose contents go to the host verbatim; the pass creates it, writes it
completely, and atomically renames it into place — it never deletes or writes
into a directory it was handed, so a partially transformed tree is
unrepresentable, which is the entire idempotence story. **The file→page map**
is the pass's central artefact: for every source file some position names, the
published page that renders it. **The needed-lines table** is keyed by the
position file — not by theory: 85 % of positioned records have no declaring
theory at all (D13), 25 theories span up to 6 files, and one file carries
records of several theories, so the file is the only key that fits both
directions. (The review corrected this last count: the original "2 files"
counted `Restriction_Spaces-HOLCF.thy`, which is not a multi-theory file but
the twin phenomenon — one theory collected under two names — and its
duplicate side was deleted in the 2026-08-23 twin cleanup; the one genuine
case is `AutoCorres2/c-parser/CLocals.thy`, whose ML machinery mints entities
for 11 theories with positions in its own file.)

### 17.1 Inputs — host-generic, and single-host in practice

The pipeline binds to no machine (user-directed, 2026-08-23): every step's
input is a path argument, and the seals below are what make an artefact
trustworthy wherever it was built.  The operating model is **one host** — the
machine that holds the semantic DB **that produced the live namespace** (the
scan must count what the namespace holds) and the rendered tree; on
2026-08-23 the rendered tree and the AFP-ALL-4 heap chain were synced from
cslh19 to this workstation (`~/.isabelle/Isabelle2025-2/browser_info`,
`~/heaps-AFP-ALL4/` — a separate directory, mounted via `ISABELLE_PATH` when
rendering, never overwriting the local heaps), so scan, map, publish, gate
and patch all run here and cslh19 retires to a backup.

1. **The rendered tree** (5.1 GB): 10,597 theory pages + 1,165 auxiliary
   pages + 34 renderer index pages + 398 non-HTML files (335 per-directory
   `isabelle.css` copies in 9 variants, 30 `session_graph.pdf`, 34
   `.browser_info/` bookkeeping files, 13 font files, `isabelle.gif`).
2. **The registry** (§7.3): whichever copy the map host holds — its identity
   (entry count + digest of the sorted names) is **sealed into the
   artefact**, and D53's zero-conflict cross-check plus the derivation's
   registry lookups are what guard correctness; private extra names
   (`Phi_System.*`, …) cannot reach a public mapping because no rendered
   page and no position file resolves to them.
3. **The corpus scan** (beside the store): the per-record position triples
   — 9,810 files, 486,346 (file, line) pairs — and the declaring-theory
   evidence the cross-check consumes; the needed-lines table is derived from
   the same triples (Q4).
4. **`data/theories.json`** (super-repo, git-tracked): the
   file-path→long-name table D53 makes the `.thy` resolver — regenerated
   with every corpus generation by the repository's own static extractor,
   guarded against staleness by the map step's three gates (§17.3), and its
   sha256 sealed into the artefact.

Everything ships as **one versioned artefact whose content hash every later
step re-checks** — and the artefact itself seals its inputs' identities
(Q3, 2026-08-23): the table's sha256, the registry fingerprint, and the
rendered tree's full `{file: size}` inventory, kept and dropped files alike,
so D51's dangling decision reads sealed data instead of the live filesystem
and publish verifies each file's size at the moment it reads it.  Downstream,
the publish report carries the artefact's hash and the gate refuses a
(tree, artefact) pair that never belonged together; the patch checkpoint and
the export checkpoint both pin the artefact hash they were started under.

### 17.2 The published layout

- **Theory pages, flat** (D49 ruling 1): `/source/<theory long name>.html`,
  the long name **derived** from the rendered location by D52's verified rule
  — the renderer names a home-session page by the theory's base name, so the
  stem alone is not the long name. Uniqueness rests on long names being
  unique by construction, not on any one render's stem census; 17 long names
  have no session component (global theories) and are ordinary pages here.
- **Auxiliary pages**: `/source/_aux/AFP/<rest>.html` for `$AFP/<rest>`
  positions, `/source/_aux/ISABELLE_HOME/<rest>.html` for `~~/<rest>` — a pure
  function of the symbolic position, computable with zero lookup, verified
  exact on all 26 `.ML` files that carry needed lines. **One page per symbolic
  path** (D49 ruling 6, as amended 2026-08-23): the 1,165 rendered copies
  collapse to 1,139 paths; the 12 paths whose copies conflict publish the
  id-union merge under the amended tolerance — line-for-line text equality
  once `<title>`/`<h1>` are set aside, the copy whose title names the
  symbolic path as the base — so all 266,134 fragment references into
  auxiliary pages keep landing.
- **Assets, generated not copied**: exactly one `/source/isabelle.css` whose
  `@font-face` URLs are absolute (`/source/fonts/…`), plus `fonts/`. The 335
  rendered CSS copies and `isabelle.gif` (referenced by nothing) are dropped.
- **Our index** (D49 ruling 5): one generated `/source/index.html`, every
  published theory long name as a link, grouped by session, alphabetical,
  styled by the same CSS. The group is the **derived long name's session
  prefix** (ruled 2026-08-23 with D52): correct for every dotted name, and a
  global theory's bare name heads its own small group — its name is its
  natural headword, so `Main` or `IFOL` standing alone is cosmetic, not
  wrong. Grouping by the rendered session *directory* was considered and
  rejected: the AFP pages' directories are the umbrella build names
  (`AFP-DEP1-0`, …), which must never leak into anything public. The
  renderer's 34 index pages and the 30 `session_graph.pdf` only they
  reference are dropped; the published tree's only other entry points are
  result cards and cross-references.
- **Everything else** (D49 ruling 4): the declared published classes are the
  five above; anything a published page references that is absent is a hard
  error the gate proves; anything present but unreferenced is dropped and
  counted in the report. No hand-written inventory to go stale.

### 17.3 The file→page map and the resolver — rewritten 2026-08-23 (D53)

For auxiliary files the map is the path function above. For `.thy` files the
resolver is **one table lookup** — the user's own insight during the review
round: a direct file-path→theory-long-name correspondence already exists and
is authoritative. `data/theories.json` (super-repo, git-tracked, 2.6 MB) maps
every session theory's long name to its source path; it is the output of the
repository's own Isabelle-side extractor (`tools/Theory_Info/Get_Thy_Info.thy`
→ `REPL_Aux.session_theory_infos`, a **static** scan of the component ROOTs
and theory headers — no heap is loaded), and it is the very input that drove
the umbrella builds, so it is same-generation with the heaps, the collection
and the rendered tree by construction.

1. **Normalise** the symbolic position (`$AFP/<x>` → the snapshot tree,
   `~~/<x>` → the distribution tree).
2. **Look up** the inverted table: path → the one long name (inversion is
   injective after the `(global)`-alias fold of the 2026-08-23 twin cleanup;
   measured zero multi-name paths over 11,524).
3. **Page**: the long name's published page by D52's derivation, with the
   two twin branches — both ruled 2026-08-23: a bare name `X` **prefers the
   session-qualified twin page `X.X`** when both pages exist (fires once on
   the real corpus), and an `X.X` name with no page of its own **falls back
   to the bare page `X`** (zero hits today — the alias fold pre-empts it —
   kept because its deadness is a property of this table generation, not a
   guarantee).  Ratified with them: the twin pages **both publish** and the
   index lists both (rendered cross-references point into each, so dropping
   either would break links); the line marks and every row link land on the
   qualified twin only.

Measured on the full corpus: 9,784 of 9,784 position files hit the table,
every resolved name has a page, `.thy` residue is **zero** — including all
1,110 pure-lemma files that carry no name-addressed record. The former
three-step resolver (declaring-hash, then stem lookup, then residue), its
shared-base-name ambiguity (115 files) and the tie-break rules proposed for
it are all retired unimplemented; the plan's earlier residue figures
described that retired design.

**The declaring-hash route survives as a mandatory cross-check, not a
resolver**: a name-addressed record's key prefix names its declaring theory
independently of any table, and the map step requires the table's answer to
agree wherever a file has such records — measured 8,674 of 8,674 files in
agreement, and one disagreement is a hard error. Two independent evidence
chains (static session structure vs collection-time keys) watch each other.

**Freshness is enforced, not remembered** (the regeneration discipline,
user-set 2026-08-23): every corpus generation regenerates `theories.json`
alongside the collection, with the same extractor over the same snapshot —
and even a forgotten regeneration cannot ship, because the map step hard-fails
on each staleness symptom: a position file absent from the table (coverage is
100 % by construction, so one miss is an error, not residue), a table name
contradicting a declaring hash (zero-conflict requirement), a resolved name
without a page (D52's derivation against the rendered tree). The table ships
inside the artefact's content hash like every other map input.

### 17.4 The transforms, one walk

Per rendered page kept by §17.2: **relocate** (the map names the output path);
**rewrite references** — per file type, not per HTML attribute: `href`/`src`
in HTML *and* `url()` in CSS, each split from its fragment, resolved against
the page's rendered location, mapped, re-emitted absolute under `/source/`,
fragment re-attached unchanged (existing entity-anchor ids are kept — pages'
internal cross-references still use them); a reference the map cannot name is
a hard error naming the page and the reference. **Except site-external
references (D50)**: a reference whose value begins with a URI scheme
(`^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9+.\-]*:`) or with `//` is emitted byte-identically — not
split at `#`, not resolved, not looked up — and counted in the report; the
same predicate, applied to the whole value before any fragment split, governs
`href`/`src` and stylesheet `url()` alike, so there is one rule and not one
per file type. Isabelle forbids `:` in every path element
(`Path.illegal_char`), so no published page can be named in a way the
predicate would mistake for a scheme. **And except input-dangling references
(D51)**: a site-internal reference whose resolved target does not exist in
the rendered tree — the input was already broken — has its `<a>` element
stripped, text kept, one WARNING per strip, every strip listed in the
report. A target that exists in the rendered tree but is missing from the
map remains a hard error: broken-by-us is never papered over. **Inject the line marks**: the
window is the content of the page's single `<pre class="source">` element;
`split("\n")` it and prefix piece *n* with `<a id="Ln"></a>` for each needed
line *n* — piece count *is* line count, so there is no line-1 or EOF edge.
Two structural facts guard every page, asserted per page because they are the
whole correctness argument: exactly one `<pre class="source">`, and no newline
inside any tag (both measured true across all 11,796 files). A needed line
with no piece to land on is a hard error — the line-fidelity assumption broke.
A page already containing `id="L<digits>"` is a hard error (measured: zero
today; the plain prefix `id="L` matches 555 innocent pages and must not be
the test). Finally the pass **generates** `/source/index.html` and
`/source/isabelle.css` from the map.

### 17.5 The link-check gate, on the published tree

- Every needed (file, line): the mapped page exists and carries `id="L<line>"`
  — zero misses required.
- Every reference in every published file — `href`/`src` in HTML, `url()` in
  CSS — resolves inside the published tree, **fragments included**: a `#L<n>`
  fragment must match an injected mark, an entity-anchor fragment must match
  an id on the target page. No fragment is trusted (D49 ruling 6 killed the
  trusted-anchors clause). A site-external reference — by §17.4's predicate
  (D50), applied to the whole value before any fragment split — is exempt
  from both checks: the gate verifies the published tree, and an external
  target is not the tree's to serve. It is counted and reported, never failed
  on; a root-absolute reference not under `/source/` remains a hard error,
  since the pass emits no such reference. **Fragments split by provenance
  (D54)**: one this pipeline composed or injected misses at zero tolerance;
  one inherited from the rendered pages is still checked but a miss is
  counted and reported — the renderer emits `offset_…` references it never
  anchors (106 today), and an inherited miss is a top-of-page landing, not
  a broken page. As amended 2026-08-24 (see D54): tolerated only under the
  twin defences — the anchored `^offset_\d+\.\.\d+$` shape AND membership
  in the committed baseline `site/expected-counters.json`.
- Every row's `source_link` from the namespace (sampled or dumped) is either
  empty or string-equal to a path the published tree serves with the named
  mark present — the end-to-end clause D49 ruling 2 bought.
- Reported, not failed: the unresolved-residue count (§17.3), the
  dropped-unreferenced count (§17.2), the exempted site-external count (D50,
  baseline 232), the stripped input-dangling count (D51, baseline 1), the
  inherited-fragment-miss count (D54, baseline 106), and the coverage
  figures — positioned 99.28 %, linked 99.28 % minus the residue.  The three
  D50/D51/D54 counters are the standing alarm for every future data update:
  read three numbers instead of re-auditing the tree.  As ruled 2026-08-24:
  the baselines for all three live in the committed
  `site/expected-counters.json` — in git, never in the artefact, so a
  baseline change is a reviewed diff that survives artefact regeneration —
  and the gate **fails** on any counter mismatch; `--update-counters` is the
  only path a baseline moves by (its refusal rules are under D54). The
  review expected the D50 number might move off 232 when the aux-base
  choice table swapped the smt_word/word_lib bases; measured at the
  2026-08-24 re-publish, it did not — the swap redirects site-internal
  references (`Zip_Benchmarks.Word` → `HOL-Library.Word`), which D50
  never counts — and all three baselines came through the re-publish
  unchanged.

### 17.6 The source-link column and the patch

`source_link`: string, `filterable: False`, the finished href
(`/source/<page>.html#L<line>`) or the empty string. For the live
`isasearch-2025-2-afp-2026-05-13`: one `patch_rows` run over all **1,337,009**
ids — 1,337,025 as exported, minus the 16 twin-duplicate rows deleted in the
2026-08-23 cleanup — (verified semantics: only named keys written, vectors
untouched, a new
attribute is fine, billing by patched size — ~100 MB of attribute data,
minutes-to-an-hour at the export's batch shape, reusing its batching and
checkpointing). The export **requires** the artefact — `--no-source-links`
is the explicit opt-out, `--dump` included (ruled 2026-08-23: a dump with
silently empty links is the same trap one level down), the two flags
together are refused, the artefact is resolved before any network action,
and a document id the artefact does not name stops the export instead of
shipping a silently empty link. Every future export carries the column from
the start —
same lesson as `from_collection`'s schema note. `site_export.py`'s schema and
`build_document` gain the field; the resolver's output file is their input.

**Executed 2026-08-24, on the user's explicit go.** All 1,337,009 rows
patched; the row count is unchanged before and after; 48 HTTP 429
backpressure events were absorbed by the widened retry budget (12 attempts,
`Retry-After` honoured over the local schedule, jitter). The checkpoint
(`pipeline/source-link-patch.checkpoint.json`) pins done = 1,337,009 and the
map artefact
`31a4b060cfb1e56383326b1247f3b682c9f97f464b436e3a4fb804dad5bd4406`.
Post-checks all green: the full gate plus namespace samples of 500 and 1000
(endpoint-pinned, zero failures), an idempotent re-patch (no-op), and a
repeat 1000-sample after a ten-minute indexing settle. Two operational facts
ruled binding: (1) naming the column in `include_attributes` **before** the
patch is HTTP 400 (measured on the pre-run drill) — never run
`gate --namespace` against a namespace the patch has not reached; (2) the
patch never runs again for this corpus — tree-side fixes ride a later
re-publish, which leaves the artefact hash and every composed `source_link`
byte-identical by design, and every future export composes the column itself
(`--source-links` required, `--no-source-links` the explicit opt-out).

### 17.7 Acceptance, and the tests that come with the code

Accepted when: the full tree maps with zero unmapped kept files, zero
unresolvable references, zero collisions; mark count equals the needed-pairs
total; the gate passes with zero misses and the two reported counts match the
resolver's; the patch dry-run against a scratch namespace round-trips; and
three hand-picked URLs render correctly against a local serving of the
published tree — `/source/HOL.HOL.html#L513` landing on `lemma conjI` (the
registry records theory HOL under `HOL.HOL`, so that is its published long
name — verified 2026-08-23, the mark sits on exactly that lemma), one AFP
theory page (`/source/Forcing.Arities.html#L235`), one `.ML` auxiliary page
(`/source/_aux/AFP/AutoCorres2/function_pointer.ML.html#L298`) — all three
checked and landing on 2026-08-23.

Unit tests (fixture trees, no cslh19, no database, no network — the list of
the 2026-08-23 implementation, 100 tests): D50's predicate (every scheme
shape external, no internal shape matching, colon-in-fragment safe); the
envelope (round trip, tamper, wrong kind/format) and the map body's load
validation (partition, index range); the composer (`source_links` per record
class, duplicate ids) and the derived needed-lines; D53's inversion (alias
fold, injectivity, prefix detection), normalisation, the one-lookup resolver
and its three staleness gates as hard errors, the agreeing cross-check, the
auxiliary residue, the page-collision guard; D52's derivation (dotted stem,
session-dir stem, global bare, underived dropped, long-name collision, the
twins deriving two names) and `page_for_name`'s twin preference plus the
`X.X`→bare fallback; reference rewriting for the three measured link shapes
plus CSS `url()`, fragments preserved, externals byte-identical and counted,
unmapped-but-present hard error, displayed `href="…"` text untouched; D51's
strip (text kept, counted and named; present-in-tree targets never
stripped); the structural assertions on every page shape and the
`id="List.…"` non-firing; the injector (placement, needed-only, EOF,
past-end, B3's source-line-count mismatch with its ±1); the id-union merge;
the index carrying the approved copy and the session-prefix grouping; and,
end to end on a fixture world (repo root + rendered tree + registry stub):
map→publish→gate green with the report's two alarm counters at their
expected values, publish refusing a moved tree, a handed directory, and
removing its own staging on failure, the gate counting a missing mark and a
renamed entity anchor; the patch against a stubbed API (every id once,
artefact-hash pinning, namespace/hash checkpoint refusals, resume
arithmetic, completed-rerun no-op, count-mismatch refusal) and the
stratified namespace sample failing on a short return.  `source_link`
emission including the empty-string case lives in the export's own tests.

### 17.8 What this section does not decide

Where the published tree is hosted (open in D47, decided with §12.2's step 5;
two facts recorded for that day: the largest page is 23.2 MiB — 7 % under the
25 MiB per-file cap some static hosts impose, before marks — and `CoreC++` is
the only name needing a one-time URL round-trip check). Nothing about the
Worker beyond the shape of `source_link`.

**Ruled 2026-08-24: Cloudflare R2, behind the D17 domain, with an edge
cache rule.** The published tree is served from an R2 bucket through the
Cloudflare edge. Cloudflare's default cache list excludes `.html`, so a
cache rule covering `/source/*` (cache everything, long TTL — a page is
immutable within a corpus generation) is part of the setup; with it, hot
pages are edge-cached and R2 origin reads approach zero. Chosen over
Cloudflare Pages to buy out two quota risks that both sit on the corpus's
growth path: the 25 MiB per-file cap (largest page measured 23.6 MiB WITH
marks at the 2026-08-24 re-publish — 5.6 % headroom) and the
20,000-files-per-deployment cap (11,750 files today). Storage cost ≈
$0.015/GB·month for 5.1 GB. The `CoreC++` `+` round-trip check runs once
the bucket serves. Setup needs a Cloudflare API token with R2 write and
`qiyuan.me` zone edit permissions, and R2 enabled on the account — both
one-time dashboard actions of the user's.
